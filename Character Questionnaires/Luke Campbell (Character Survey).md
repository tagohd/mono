## "Wispy"
Answer these questions as the author.
### Basic
- What is your character’s name?
	- Luke Campbell. Just "Luke", not short for "Lucas".
	- Middle name?
- What is their physical sex?
	- Male
- What is their gender?
	- Male
- How old are they?
	- At the start of the story, he's about a month away from turning 18.
- How tall are they?
	- 160 cm (5'3")
- What is their weight?
	- 52.1 kg (115 lbs.)
- What is their eye color?
	- Green?
- What is their hair color?
	- Brown/chestnut?
- What is their hair style?
	- Shoulder length, usually tied back into a ponytail
- Do they have any distinguishing facial features?
	- Do his dog ears count?
- Do they have any birthmarks?
	- I don't think so? None that are usually visible, anyway.
- Do they have any scars?
	- Probably a few, mostly on his hands and arms from farm work, but also from liking to play with knives and swords.
- Do they have any tattoos or other markings?
	- No.
- Do they wear any jewelry?
	- Before the story? Not really. He might wear [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]] as a necklace, though.
- How do they dress most of the time?
	- He's a kid in high school, so I'm going to say he dresses fairly casually most of the time.
- Do they wear any accessories not listed above?
	- I don't think so.

### Advanced
- Do they have any allergies, diseases, or other physical differences (such as blindness) from birth at the start of your story?
	- Like most real dogs (but not necessarily like most dog-people), Luke is [[LukeVISION (TM)|colorblind]]. He can't distinguish shades of red.
	- He also has some mild hip dysplasia. This doesn't usually affect him too much, but it can make running painful.
- Do they have any neurological differences from birth at the start of the story (autism, OCD, etc. )?
	- Yeah, I'm pretty sure I accidentally gave him ADHD, just based on what I've already written about him. He's impulsive, disorganized, and occasionally forgetful. Maybe it's not so much that he's stupid, but that he has trouble paying attention in school.
- Do they have physical or mental differences from an earlier point in life at the start of your story (PTSD, etc.)?
	- Not at the start of the story, no ;)
- What is their sexual preference?
	- He'd be happy dating someone of any gender, perhaps even multiple people. But sex isn't really a big priority for him; it's just not something he really thinks about.
	- He's not completely lacking in libido, however, nor is he sex-repulsed; he's open to the idea, with the right person(s) at the right time. Like I said, it's just not a priority for him. If he gets laid, great. If not, it's not the end of the world for him.
- Are they right or left handed?
	- Right.
- What does their voice sound like?
	- He has a southern accent. He talks like a cowboy. Being petite as he is, his voice probably isn't too deep, but it's still masculine. If you were talking to him on the phone, you wouldn't think a woman had answered. Let's say he sings tenor.
- What social class do they belong to?
	- I'm not sure. His parents aren't millionaires, but they do own a farm and can afford at least one horse. I guess they're middle class?
- Did they come from money?
	- Not really.

### Fantasy/Sci-Fi
- If they are nonhuman, what species are they?
	- He's a dogboy!
- Are they an artificial species (robot, golem, etc.)?
	- No.
- Are they a hybrid species (i.e.- half human, half vampire)? How does this benefit them?
	- Dog-human hybrid. Everyone in the story is an animal-human hybrid, though, so I don't think he really has any unique benefits. He can hear better than a regular human, for example, but so can pretty much everyone else.
	- For the most part, he's just a regular human who happens to look like a dog and have a dog-like personality.
- What powers do they have? Do they have none at all?
	- He can remember the previous timelines, or at least remember them better than others. Other than that, he's not special. Anyone can learn magic, and most can do it better than he can.
- How did they first learn of their abilities?
	- By remembering the previous timelines? Seems pretty self-explanatory. But [[James Redawić|James]] confirms that he is, in fact, remembering them and not just experiencing déjà vu.
- Do they have any magical items or weapons? How did they obtain their magical items?
	- Not at the beginning of the story, but [[The Mothers Campbell|his moms]] give him [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]] pretty early on. It's been handed down the Campbell family line for generations!
- Does your character have any weaknesses when it comes to their species, powers or magical items?
	- He should not eat chocolate. It probably won't kill him, but it could make him sick.
	- As a novice mage, he gets [[Mana#Mana Toxicity|sick]] if he tries to cast too powerful a spell.
- If your character was formerly human (or any species other than what they are currently), tell the story of how they became what they currently are.
	- N/A

# wisteria-lodge
- What is the character's go-to drink order? (How do they like to be publicly perceived?)
	- He's 16? I don't think he really drinks that much. But he wants to be liked, and he wants to present himself as approachable. Plus, he's a farm boy. He probably wouldn't order anything too fancy, but he's also willing to try whatever's recommended to him.
- What is their grooming routine? (How do they treat themselves in private?)
	- He probably showers pretty often, if only to cool down after running, but he also gets dirty doing chores around the farm. Maybe not the best at remembering to put on deodorant or brush his teeth, though. (If they're all animals, maybe deodorant isn't that big of a thing...)
	- I don't think he needs to shave very often yet. Maybe once a week at most.
- What was their most expensive purchase/where does their disposable income go?
	- We've established that he's the kinda guy to go to Renaissance Faires and he owns a suit of armor. So, that's probably his most expensive purchase. He likes swords and knives, too.
- Do they have any scars or tattoos?
	- No tattoos, but he probably has a few scars on his hands and arms from working on the farm and from having "sharp objects" as a hobby. He's probably broken a few bones before, too, likely from falling off of [[Luke's Noble Steed|Pauline]].
- When was the last time they cried, and under what circumstances?
	- Depends on when you ask, because I've already written a few instances of him crying. He cries when he feels scared or hopeless. He also cries during sad movies. He's not afraid to cry.
- Are they an oldest, middle, youngest, or only child?
	- He's an only child.
- Describe the shoes they're wearing.
	- Either running shoes or boots. He lives on a farm, so they tend to be dirty. He cleans them every now and then, but they don't stay clean for long.
- Describe the place where they sleep. (What does their safe space look like?)
	- His room's probably pretty messy. He has a stand for his armor, and probably a few places on the wall(s) for his blades. (Or maybe he doesn't have space to keep all those in his room.) Maybe he has some fantasy art or posters depicting knights and dragons and whatnot. He has a twin (single) bed.
- What is their (least) favorite holiday? (How do they relate to their culture/outside world?)
	- Least favorite: Mother's Day. He has **three** moms! Finding the right gifts for all of them can be very stressful. (Not a big fan of [[Winterday]] for similar reasons.)
- What objects do they always carry around with them? (What do they need for their normal, day-to-day routine? What does "normal" even look like for them?)
	- Before the story: He's in school still, so he might get in trouble if he brought a knife. (It's a rural school, though, so they're probably a bit more lax about that.) But he doesn't really carry anything too out of the ordinary most days. Notebooks, pen/pencil, a change of clothes for running, phone, wallet, water bottle. Maybe some ibuprofen for his hips.
