>Also a random thought I've had, your music would fit great as D&D background music. Maybe getting some songs into D&D playlists could help for popularity (I mean, imagine earning not one but TWO dollars!)

sudoscience:
>Oh, wow, I could double my theoretical income
>But that's actually a good idea
>Also, YouTube says the top video recommending my content is "Songs that make you feel like a villain"
>It doesn't tell me which of my videos got suggested, though
>I'm feeling a little attacked by their algorithm. It just recommended a video to me that was about how to release an album when you have 0 fans

lunathrix:
>Oh... that may have been because of me... I was listening to a losing proposition and the next one in autoplay was that "songs that make you feel like a villain" thing, so I had to go back from there to your song pretty regularly
>I was just scrolling through youtube and got recommended a beginner's tutorial to digital painting... The algorithm really has no mercy for anyone huh

sudoscience:
>Well, does my song make you feel like a villain at least?

lunathrix:
>Does wounded knight facing a [[The Dragon|giant one-winged dragon]] count as a villain?
>You could see it as animal abuse?

sudoscience:
>Well, the knight is probably the villain from the dragon's perspective, at least. Or maybe it's a really chill dragon, and the knight is just attacking it for no reason? Maybe the knight wants revenge but is attacking the wrong dragon? Idk

lunathrix:
>Ok but that "knight attacking the wrong dragon" is hilarious. Imagine a knight on this giant quest for vengeance, finally coming face to face with the dragon after years of tracking it down, and it's just like "Bro... you got the wrong guy. Rektar the Terrible attacked your town and ate your family. I'm Lisa the Puppysaver. I'm literally vegan. Sorry for your loss though".

>Man I am all on board for team "dragons are cool and don't kill them". Dragons are awesome. I love dragons. Merry christmas btw.

L:
>By the by, do you have any idea for how you would call your first album?

S:
>I have several ideas, actually. If I was sticking with the hero's journey thing, my original plan was to split it into 3 EPs and name them after the 3 acts of [[README|the hero's journey]]: Departure, Initiation, and Return. Then the whole album would be called MONO, but it would just be all 3 EPs in one album. The problem there is that the songs I've written so far aren't necessarily all from the same "act".
>If I published the 6 songs I have now, I'd probably call it "The [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]] EP", since most of the songs borrow melodies from "James Still Remembers You". I might also just name it after one of the tracks, probably either "James Still Remembers You" or "A Losing Proposition".
>The other problem is that I've been thinking I should probably write a few more songs first. The copyright office will let me register up to 10 unpublished songs in a single application for $85, so I figure I should write 4 more songs to get my money's worth. If they're already published, it's $45/song.

L:
>probably gonna start doodling some ideas now and then. If you have any ideas or sketches, please send em right up!

S:
>![[A Losing Proposition.png]]
>It doesn't have to be exactly this, but this is roughly what I had in mind in terms of text placement.
