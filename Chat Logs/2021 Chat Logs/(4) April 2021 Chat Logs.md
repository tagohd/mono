>Any preference for the appearance of [[Luke Campbell|the protagonist]]?

S:
>What you have now is fine. I was thinking since it is supposed to be about The Hero with a Thousand Faces, maybe it doesn't really matter if they have a consistent appearance, or maybe we don't ever see their face. Maybe it's a story that takes place across generations and spans multiple heroes.
>Or maybe they literally have 1,000 faces, but I don't think my music is creepy enough for that
>Plus, that would be a huge pain to draw

L:
>Maybe they have 1000 very kind looking faces. Would be terrifying if it wasn't for their warm smiles

S:
>ðŸ¦ž?

L:
>Sometimes it's 2 am and you think "this needs some ðŸ¦ž"

S:
>Given that it's currently 3am here, I'm inclined to agree

L:
>Is it about as you expected?

S:
>Very ðŸ¦ž

L:
>Because honestly I could work 20 more hours on it adding details but a) I'm afraid of overrendering and b) none is ever going to view it on a big enough size to notice them
>I'm glad you think it's ðŸ¦ž though

S:
>I like the little crest on the back of the armor. I'm assuming it's supposed to be a flower of some sort?

L:
>It's flower-inspired yeah
>I mostly just made it up as I went but then it looked kinda flowery so I made it more flowery

\[...\]

S:
>I was going to say if the crest is a flower, maybe I can find some way to tie it into [New in Town](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24263062/chapters/58473370) somehow. Speaking of things I'd all but forgotten about
>Maybe the protagonist is Rudy, not Luke

L:
>oh that would be cool
>But then what would that make the dragon? A boss monster?

S:
>![[utdragon.png]]
>It's this guy

L:
>lmao
>It better be that guy
>What part of the game is he even from I don't remember any of those 3 characters

S:
>That's because it's a screenshot from Undertale. I'm not sure if any of them have appeared in Deltarune yet
>It's the MTT Resort

L:
>Bold of you to assume I haven't played undertale and did a genocide route just to give my soul to the chara donation fund
>(and then pacifist because I felt bad)

S:
>Bold of you to assume I assumed that when I actually assumed you assumed it was a screenshot of Deltarune

L:
>Bold of you to assume I assumed it was a screenshot of Deltarune when I actually know very well Kris wears green and yellow like chara in the overworld (chara fanclub)
>I hope he makes it into DR though
>as the final boss of course

S:
>I don't have a retort to that, but I assume if we keep using the word assume at this rate it will assume a position of having lost all meaning
>You have to take the elevator to [[Eeby Deeby]] to fight him

L:
>Assumedly?
