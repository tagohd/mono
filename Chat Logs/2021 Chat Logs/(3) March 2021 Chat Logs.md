L:
>Hey are you still interested in the album art? Because I've been waiting for some of your ideas but have recently realized you may also be waiting for me to send more ideas
>Which would really result in a bit of a stationary situation

S:
>Oh, lol, that's kinda what happened. I thought we were going with the knight one, and you were, like, putting the finishing touches on it or something, but I didn't want to rush you or anything since you've doing it for free.
>\*you're

L:
>So it is as the prophecies foretold
>We were both too anxious to send the other a singular text message
>So do you really want to go with the knight one? It was kind of just a random idea, i think you could probably come up with something cooler

S:
>I probably could, but I'd need to listen to it again. I feel like I did actually have an idea about that the other day (by which I mean a few weeks ago), but I don't remember what it was. I've kinda swung the other way on it by this point: I was ready to flex my traps and just do it, but I couldn't upload it without the album art. Now I'm reconsidering whether I really want to upload it just yet. Maybe I should let a professional look at the mixing and mastering.^[I should have done that.]

L:
>Do you mean a new song or the ones you've already made?

S:
>I meant The James EP. None of my new songs are at the point where I'm ready to add them to an album. For now, I'm thinking I'm going to keep the track listing as is. Not planning on adding any other songs to it at this time. The new ones will be a separate EP most likely

L:
>Oh ok like that! Mixing does seem to have a pretty big impact on a song, though I think you did quite well at it for being rather inexperienced at it
>I also think it's kind off fun to go back to someone's older songs and notice how much they improved at mixing, but if you want it great from the get-go I think that's fair too

## Album Art Discussion

L:
>Have you made up your mind on the album art? If not I could try sketching some more ideas in the knight-vibes (I'm just excited to make album art ok)

S:
>Oh, damn, I actually kinda forgot about that. I did re-listen to it, but instead of having any ideas about album art, I think I was just like, "What if I redid all the songs in the Earthbound soundfont?" And then I didn't do that. The knight probably wouldn't be that great of a fit for an Earthbound version, but it should be fine for the album in its current state. I'll let you know if I come up with any better ideas.
>One of my friends says I should go with the one that's literally just Sans. I personally don't think of it as an Undertale fan album, but a different friend remarked that it seemed heavily inspired by Toby Fox, so maybe they're on to something. I'll keep that on the back burner for now, but it's not my first choice.
>Maybe that would be more appropriate if I did do the Earthbound idea, since the Earthbound soundfont constitutes like 90% of the Undertale soundfont.

L:
>You know if you want to go undertale related, I've had this idea in mind for an undertale-inspired empty throneroom with like one dude in the middle being all dramatic?

S:
>That might work. At the very least, it would probably go well with the songs from later in the "game".
>Not that I've even begun to think about writing those.

L:
>I mean who likes planning ahead am I right
>I am interested now in the earthbound versions of your songs though
>I only played a bit of mother 1 but the music was g r o o v y

S:
>Yeah, I might need to try that when I finish The Legend, which, surprisingly, I am making good progress on. I guess things are simplified when the song is mostly already written.

## What If: Dragon?

S:
>\[Screenshot of [[(12) December 2020 Chat Logs#^2a6e51]] "Does wounded knight facing a giant one-winged dragon count as a villain?"\]
>Lol, I just realized that could be a song idea: "One Winged Dragon", like "One Winged Angel"

L:
>Oh have you seen the video on Uematsu composed that song??? It was really funny he just composed different parts and pasted them together later
>on how* he composed it. Goddamn I should read things before I send them
>Maybe you should try that out for your new hit single one winged dragon™

S:
>No, I'll have to check that out, but I listened to the song again after reading that, and I believe it.

S:
>[[Plata#Snowy Village]] 
>>It looks like a quaint little village. Snow gathers atop the roofs, and children, bundled up in warm layers, run about pelting each other with snowballs while their parents sip hot drinks indoors. There’s something off here, though; something sinister beneath the surface. You aren’t sure what it is, but you find something about this village unsettling. Best not stay here too long if you don’t wish to find out.
>Oh, and I did have an idea for album art, which is funny because I actually don't really care for this song; I think I like the description more than I like the song itself. Hold on while I try and communicate the visual to you telepathically...

S:
>Damn, guess I don't have telepathy. I'll just have to attempt to describe it, then. The village is in a valley overlooked by a cliff, and there are some mountains behind it. It looks kinda like Snowdin, but it's actually sort of in the background (midground?), so it doesn't really matter. In the foreground, our hero, [[Luke Campbell|royalty-free Link]], has stopped his horse ([[Luke's Noble Steed|royalty-free Epona]]) at the edge of the cliff to observe the village below before continuing down towards it. In the mountains, way off in the distance, is the entrance to [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|the dragon's]] lair ("Link" doesn't know this yet, however).
>Also, you absolutely don't have to do this, but I was thinking it would be cool if you could actually kinda see the dragon in its cave if you zoomed in really far, but that would probably require the image to be insanely high-res.
>I'm pretty sure my "game" wasn't originally going to be high fantasy, but it's definitely easier to imagine art for it that way. It's also pretty funny to think about just, not changing some of the details. Like, the last boss is still named "[[CURSED AL|Cursed Al]]", but now he's a dragon. Actually, I guess the last boss just being some guy named Al is already pretty funny, but a dragon named Al is still funnier. It's just... not an intimidating name at all. Ganondorf... Sephiroth... Al.

L:
>First of all, BIG FAN of royalty free link
>Sounds like a fun idea! I was actually in the mood to try some landscapes so I'll make some sketches of it real soon
>And what if Al isn't his full name? It could be short for something even less intimidating. Alex. Albert. Alice.

S:
>![[carlton.gif]]
>Or maybe it's short for Alfonso Ribeiro
>That's the last boss, the ultimate evil threatening to destroy the entire tri-state area: Carlton Banks. His battle theme is just an 8-bit version of It's Not Unusual
>But, also, he's, like, stupid hard. He's like Sans. You think he'll be an easy fight until you die on the first turn
>https://youtu.be/zjImpr03L94 \[8-bit remix of "It's Not Unusual\] He's also like Mettaton EX because he's just doing that the whole fight. You cannot grasp the true form of Carlton's attack.

#Gameplay 
gameplay:: The boss fight against AL is deceptively hard. And also he dances the whole fight like MTT EX.

L:
>There's just one problem in having Carlton Banks as your sans - would anyone really think it would be an easy fight?
>The man exudes power with dance moves alone

S:
>Fair, but I think I'd rather fight Carlton than Will. Idk, though, I'm not exactly well versed in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air lore

L:
>I haven't watched a single episode but I didn't need to see more than one video of that man dancing to be afraid of his power

## Undyne?!

L:
>![[alp_art3.png]]
>Made some thumbnails to see how close I could get to what you imagined, the sneaky dragon thing was a bit hard because these are very low res but it wont be a problem in the real thing
>(final version will also have colors of course, except if you want monochrome/bw)

S:
>Those are all great, but I'd say the first one is like a 90% match to what I had in mind, which is pretty good for trans-Atlantic telepathy. (I had to think REALLY hard to send it that far.) I like aspects of all of them, though.
>Basically, keep most of #1, but Luke/Link/Undyne/whoever is mounted on the horse like in #2 and add the big honkin' mountain from #3. (I also like that it's actively snowing in #2, but that's not too important.)

L:
>Oooo 90% those are some good numbers
>The protag is called Luke now btw?

S:
>I think [[Luke Campbell]] was the name I came up with at first. Luke as in Luke Skywalker, and Campbell as in Joseph Campbell, author of The Hero with a Thousand Faces.

L:
>that is one fancy book. I have some vague recollection of discussing it during greek or latin or something
>did you actually read it?

S:
>I have not. It was mostly just because I couldn't be bothered to come up with a real plot, so I figured it could just be the monomyth. I still have no intention of making a real game; it was supposed to just be a set of writing prompts for the music.
>Actually making a game would be like Tolkien writing The Lord of the Rings because he wanted his made-up language to have a backstory
>Anyway, my point is, the hero's name doesn't really matter. I just wanted something better than just calling him "The Hero". But, I suppose I should stick with just one name for the sake of consistency.

L:
>Campbell just makes me think soup
>Which is a good thing in a way, because I like soup

S:
>[[Luke Campbell#Lucas Progresso|Lucas Progresso]]

L:
>lucas progresso?

S:
>Maybe that's his fake name
>Because Progresso is also a brand of soup. Do they not have that in Belgium?

\[...\]

S:
>But, yeah, until I name a song after him, the name is flexible. I mean, I was originally imagining the game would take place in a more modern, mostly realistic setting, but now the hero is riding horses and fighting dragons, which I guess is appropriate since it's just supposed to be the hero's journey.
>It doesn't matter who the hero is. They're gonna need a kickass soundtrack no matter what

L:
>That's what I like to hear
>Also mix of realistic world with fantasy animals when
>I love urban fantasy settings

S:
>Lol, maybe he's on horseback because the dragon's cave is inaccessible by car

L:
>Maybe he's just a really green guy
>Fire magic jumpstarted the industrial revolution there and now they have climate change problems too
>Air magicians are still trying to figure out how to clean the air

S:
>I think it will be fine without any text. Plus, it eliminates several other decisions for me, like what font to use, and what the actual name of the album is. Well, I guess I'll still need to decide that one, but it lets me put it off.
>I'm not sure I really want to call it "The James EP". One of the song titles would probably be a better name.
>But the title needs to match whatever is on the album art, if it's on the album art

L:
>Doing your best to delay annoying decisions, I like your style
>What was the reasoning behind the title the James EP again? Since the hero is called Luke and you go by Alan Waterford
>I'm not telling you to call it The Campbell Chronicles but actually I am
>followup album: The Soup Story

S:
>Luke is [[Luke Campbell|Luke]], and [[James Redawić|James]] is kinda like Obi-Wan. Most of the songs were originally supposed to be about James in a way. Like, [[Plata|the village]] in Snowy Village is where James lives, and A Losing Proposition was actually about Luke fighting James and accidentally killing him (I imagined it going kinda like the Toriel fight, except you have to kill him), which is why the song ends with the melody from James Still Remembers You, which I guess was supposed to be James's theme.
>The other two songs don't really fit in with that idea, though, and now I guess Proposition is about a dragon? Nothing wrong with that, but it is part of why I'm considering calling it something else
>Idk, honestly I'm kinda writing the songs first and coming up with the story later

L:
>I retract all my comments on the album title Obi-Wan definitely deserves an album in his honor
