>Okay, I spent about an hour in Ableton last night, about half of which was spent ostensibly working on your song (read: playing HK songs on the piano and hoping inspiration struck), and the other half was spent finishing up an existing project. I did come up with a cool sounding melody, but I didn't think it would work for this project; not upbeat enough. I can send you that anyway if you want, but it will have to wait until I get home from work

L:
>please dont feel rushed to send me stuff for the thing, I have the patience of 200 stars
>that being said if you want to send me cool WIPs i always want to listen to the cool WIPs

S:
>Okay, added you to a Google Drive, uploaded the WIP
>![[NES Legend of Zelda Vibes.mp3]]

L:
>hohoho I am part of the exclusive cool club now
>sounds cool!
>not at all upbeat as you said
>more of a [[2.4 Atonement with the Father|"Father... I will avenge you..."]] kinda song

S:
>Yeah, it was more just, "Hey, this is cool! I can't use this here, but I should definitely save it for later.^[Hey, what do you know?]"
