>So what's the story you're envisioning with the song?
>still menacing city go brrr?

S:
>Hmm, that's a good question, actually...
>\*refuses to elaborate\*

L:
>thats fair

S:
>I guess [[Rhapsody#Searching for Inspiration|what I wrote about it initially]] still kinda applies? Except now there's also a boss fight or something
>My piano teacher had joked that it's kinda like you're going through different neighborhoods of the city. Like, you've got Section A when you first enter the city, and then you go through, like, a Cuban neighborhood and Section B starts playing. I'm not sure about that idea, though
>But he hasn't seen this version yet
>Last one I showed him was the same as the last one I sent you. It still had the part where I plagiarized Omori
>Instead, I now have the part where I (unintentionally) plagiarized One Winged Angel

L:
>a very light plagiarization though
>2 notews

S:
>Maybe A-C (or at least A-B) is like a flashback of how the city used to be, and D-E represent how it is now. Not actually sure where C fits into that

L:
>i think you just invented a new way of story writing
>have idea for story \> write fitting song \> continue tinkering on song \> song no longer fits story \> adapt story accordingly
>ğŸ§ 

S:
>The songs actually come first, which is why the story is pretty vague. Your way might be easier, though. Kinda hard to just come up with a song from nowhere. Would definitely make coming up with titles easier. The original title of this song was just "Jazzy Thing", so the stuff about the city that hates you was very much after the fact

L:
>i may already have made a sketch based on the song

S:
>:D

L:
>you write very illustration-invoking songs somehow

S:
>Magick

L:
>should have known...

>first half ver
>![[rhapsody_art2.png]]
>and second half ver

S:
>Oooh, I love it! Kinda makes me think of The Abyss

L:
>didnt even cross my mind, but i do see it
>hk has taken over my brain
>apparently

S:
>I mean, I wasn't actively channeling it either, but dead/dying cities is a bit of a recurring theme for the game, so it seems appropriate

L:
>i guess i get to do a little unintentional plagiarizing too
>as a treat

S:
>Welcome to the club
