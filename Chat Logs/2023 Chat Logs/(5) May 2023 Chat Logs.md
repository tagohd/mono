>Ooh, I like [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|the mystery object]]! I actually didn't notice that in the first sketch

lunathrix:
>it orb

sudoscience:
>For pondering, of course

lunathrix:
>its your story
>the driving factor in the story may as well be the need to ponder

sudoscience:
>![[alp_art2.png]]
>You were correct that this is at least the second time you've tried to give me album art that's just Sans Undertale
>That's going to be the climax of the story: he's going to throw the orb at [[CURSED AL|Cursed Al]] and yell, "Ponder THIS, bitch!"
>But Al's going to catch it and be like "gettttttt dunked on!!!"

lunathrix:
>my album art sanses are getting ruder...
>Al is secretly [[Steve the Royalty-Free Skeleton|steve the royalty free skeleton]]?!
>what a twist!!!

S:
>That's the secret: everyone has a skeleton inside them
>Except for [[Boring Straight Greg|the token cishet]]. His skeleton exploded
>It \*was\* inside him

S:
>[[Steve the Royalty-Free Skeleton|Sans Undertale]]?!

L:
>oh yeah thats not placeholder text thats for realsies

S:
>I would love to approve that, but it's ultimately not my decision. It's up to the Boss Baby. I mean CD Baby
>And maybe also Toby Fox

L:
>boss baby = sans undertale?!?!!?

S:
>Aside from that, I like the art. I think it's a good direction. Maybe it's the, um, sketchiness of it, but do you think you could make the protagonist look less... evil?

\[...\]

L:
>ah the evilness
>yeah mb i like drawing people fucked up and evil
>i will make him not evil in the render
>though in all honesty you gave me Evil Red to work with

\[...\]

S:
>That's fair. Nothing against evil and fucked up characters in general. Plus, I mean, who knows what he had to do to get that orb? Maybe it's like the One Ring and it corrupts him? (I'm literally just making this shit up as we go, if you can't tell by now)

## Does he look like a bitch?

L:
>so how evil looking would you like the man?
>also, how would you like the man to look in the first place?
>cause currently i just winged a character design for him in my initial sketch and stuck with it
>but it may be worth investing a smidgeon of time in actually working that out a bit
>![[various_lukes.png]]
>this is how i imagine him atm by the by

S:
>![[sudorimeTurbo3000.png]]
>Well, I imagine he looks like this, but from the front
>![[various_lukes_cropped.jpg]]
>These are pretty good. Maybe it's like the Deltarune Chapter 1 ending: you think he's going to do something horrible with the orb, but actually he just does that. Like, that's obviously not his end goal, but it's something that happens

\[...\]

## THE ~~CLAW~~ ORB

S:
>Actually, maybe that *is* his end goal.
>![[THE_ORB.jpg]]
>Behold: [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|The Orb]]
>Eating it is the only thing that can save the people whose souls were stolen by Cursed Al. It's also the last one they had in stock. He's really not supposed to eat it, but that's its corrupting influence: being really tasty.
>This will, of course, be played completely straight. The characters will never acknowledge how ridiculous the premise is

## He actually does look like a bitch

S:
>Oh, wait, I just remembered... Didn't I say that in addition to everyone being queer, they're also all furries? Heh, maybe that's another reason Luke really shouldn't eat the chocolate orange: he's a dogboy
>Or maybe some kind of fox? But foxes are canids, so I'm assuming they probably can't eat chocolate either
>Don't worry that chocolate is toxic to other animals, though. The rules only apply when they're funny

L:
>alright there's a lot to unpack here
>\1. ah fuck i forgot i gave him medieval fucking fantasy armor and a horse
>and now i drew him with a backpack and a jacket
>and also there's a modern-ish town behind him?
>what time period / scenario does this story take place in anyway
>more importantly, im attached to the pony tail nowmaybe he breaks every rule of being a fictional character and he changes his hairstyle now and then

S:
>Default appearance vs. customization unlocked

L:
>\2. haha yes get SIAMESed
>maybe its his evil and fucked up appearance
>just a ponytail
>\3. does this mean i should give him animal ears
>because i can and will

S:
>He went through a lot to get that chocolate orange, including a barber shop

L:
>lol

S:
>Idk what time period it takes place in. I was thinking vaguely modern, but yeah, he does have armor and a horse in that first picture... So, maybe that just gets retconned, or maybe the starting area is just like, really far behind the times and no one bothered to tell them it's not the middle ages anymore. Maybe there's time travel fuckery involved (probably not). Maybe he's just, like, really into renaissance fairs.

## Fuzzy Logic

S:
>But wait. If they're all furries, why is he riding a [[Luke's Noble Steed|horse]]?
>How does that work?
>Maybe it doesn't matter after all. Like I've said, I want to redo all the songs on that album anyway and bring them up to my current standards, so maybe we can just do different album art for that when I finish it and pretend the first one never happened. So it basically just gets retconned. "What do you mean he's wearing armor and riding a horse? No he's not. I don't know what you're talking about."
>But to answer my own question, I see 3 options: 1) he's not riding a horse, 2) just because it's a furry world doesn't mean *every* animal is sentient, or 3) the horse *is* sentient, but he's just into that

S:
>And to answer your question, yes, you should give him animal ears
>And a snoot
>Oh! Maybe it IS a modern-ish setting, but the village isn't accessible by car, so he has to ride a horse, possibly for stealth reasons and possibly because the horse has some sort of kink

L:
>it feels like we're getting into a pluto/goofy situation
>im not certain im entirely comfortable with drawing the kinky horse again if the need ever arises
>now that i know thats whats been going on

S:
>You mean to tell me Pluto *doesn't* have some kind of pet play fetish?

L:
>im telling you i try not to think about it too much

S:
>Maybe we should go with one of the other two options then. I'm not sure I want him to be Luke "Cybersmith" Campbell

L:
>i dont get the reference :(

S:
>Human pet guy?

L:
>ah
>i think option 2 is nice
>it could be an area with lots of horses and people that dont like cycling

S:
>There is a lot of snow, but I guess they probably make bikes that can handle that. I wouldn't know, though. It's generally not a concern at my latitude

L:
>ive cycled through snow plenty of times, though ill admit its only ever a few cms tops
>if it really is a thick layer of snow, horses wont particularly enjoy it either though^[What if it's a Skyrim horse?]

L:
>as for the armor, let's say he just came back from a renaissance fair in that picture until we redo it
>oh and im not giving him a snoot
>those are a nightmare to draw in front facing perspective
>only a trueblood furry artist could make that work

S:
>Darn, but fair enough

## Maybe don't google "dogboy breed"
L:
>![[dog_luke.png]]
>hanging down ears or upright ears

S:
>Hmmm, I suppose that would depend on the emotion to some extent, but also what breed of dogboy he is

L:
>well, my favorite dogs are samoyed
>upright ones are also nicer for emotions

S:
>I was thinking droopy ears that perk up when he's excited, but maybe always up would be better

L:
>then its decided
>not sure how we're gonna explain the addition of dog ears since the previous album art
>and a tail?
>its my first time drawing a dog boy, i kinda wanna go the whole way

S:
>How can you say that while refusing to give him a snoot?

L:
>snoot is no longer a dogboy
>thats anthropomorphic dog

\[...\]

## Furites paradox
S:
>These are deep philosophical questions. How many doglike features can you add before he goes from dogboy to anthro?

L:
>its a thin line
>but i consider the dog ears and tail to be mostly an addition, while snoot/fur is more of a change than an addition
>if that makes sense

S:
>See, I was envisioning them as full on furries, but if we want to maintain some semblance of continuity with the first album art, maybe his ears normally hang down, and you just couldn't see them. You also can't see his tail because it blended in with the horse

L:
>and the armor was from a renaissance fair
>and the horse was there because he doesnt like cycling
>maybe we should go for the retcon
>or really go with "base your lore on trying to explain previous album arts"

S:
>I was going to say that you couldn't see his ears because he's wearing a helmet, but he actually isn't wearing a helmet
>I thought I'd already established that I'm making this stuff up as I go along anyway
>But I really should go to bed now

L:
>indeed, good night!

S:
>I mean, I'm already basing the lore on the songs instead of the other way around. Oh, I've got it! Maybe he started as a regular human and got turned into a dogboy
>There, problem solved
>He's a weredogboy

L:
>i actually had an idea on why you cant see his ears and tail in the first album art which is hugely convoluted and led to a few dozen more ideas on the story
>it was in fact so complicated i was currently writing it in a google doc
>if you're interested in that

S:

>So this is basically the climax of the game

L:
>yes
>absolutely even

S:
>And look! It's even red!

L:
>this cant be a coincidence
>this story was fated to be written

S:
>Love the idea that they're all idiots

L:
>to complete the trifecta, they are all: 1. queer 2. furries 3. idiots

S:
>Yes, this is all canon now as far as I'm concerned

L:
>im overtaken by joy

\[...\]

## Continuity? I don't know her
S:
>So with the Emperor/Empress, I'm guessing this makes Cursed Al more like Darth Vader, and he's serving a gender-fluid Palpatine?^[Maybe The Emperoress is actually [[The Dragon]]?]

L:
>I completely forgot who Cursed Al is or what his role in the story is
>maybe you should turn that google doc into a lore summary thing?^[On it, boss!]

\[...\]

S:
>![[A Losing Proposition.png]]
>We also need to figure out where this guy fits into things
>Both the knight and the dragon, actually

L:
>that was at the renaissance fair
>obviously

S:
>Of course

L:
>things got a little wild
>the dragon was not planned
>maybe it was revived... with a cursed orb...

S:
>The real cursed orb is actually the dragon's egg, but Luke grabbed a chocolate orange instead
>Because he's an idiot
>And no one else noticed that it's a chocolate orange because they're also idiots

L:
>oh, so the cursed orb he got quested to get was never made from chocolate in the first place
>he just thought it was
>yeah that makes sense

S:
>Or maybe whoever sent them on the quest to retrieve the egg just didn't do a very good job describing it

L:
>according to the new lore luke thought it was chocolate from the get-go, so he must have just misinterpreted
>he knows a stunningly small amount of round items and just went of assumptions
>round item in city? cities are where they sell food. thats a chocolate orange

S:
>Something like that happens in Mother 3 actually. Duster has to get this artifact from the castle, and his dad's like, "You'll know it when you see it." Spoiler: he did not know it when he saw it

L:
>undertale, mother: we are gonna reference all the great works

S:
>Of course

L:
>i really have to go sleep now
>but i thank you for going on this journey with me

S:
>If it's supposed to be based on the monomyth, it's fitting that it would be reminiscent of many other stories
