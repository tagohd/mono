## New CURSED AL Song?
S:
>Although, I did have something of an idea for a completely unrelated song

L:
>do tell

S:
>Hold on, need to turn the computer back on

L:
>the tension is building!...

S:
>Oh, wait, I think I accidentally just wrote Soul Sanctum...
>Whatever, here's the SoundCloud link: https://soundcloud.com/tagohd/cursed-domain/s-sgLjzFTHov0

L:
>classic sudo

S:
>It's a curse, I tell you
>I mean, it's not exactly Soul Sanctum, but you can hear the similarity, right?

L:
>its mostly the bass, no?
>i think it you change that it wont sound very similar anymore

S:
>Yeah. I was just screwing around on the piano and thought, "Hey, this sounds cool and foreboding. Maybe it can be, like, the theme of [[CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN|the bad guy's castle]]"

L:
>"maybe the bad guy uses some sort of [[SOUL|soul]] magic or something"
>but no it does sound v cool

S:
>[[CURSED AL#Al, THE SOUL TAKER|Al, THE SOUL TAKER]]
>>With enough [[SOUL|souls]], he will become godlike. His essence is eternal, but there has always been someone to banish him. Souls taken by Al are gradually forgotten until they all but disappear from existence.
>>
>>What draws people to Al? Not what makes someone willing to forfeit their soul, but what are the first steps? Does Al seek them out, or is he summoned?
>Uh...
>To be fair, I'm pretty sure I wrote that before I played Hollow Knight

L:
>lmao

S:
>I mean, that's pretty clearly inspired by Undertale

L:
>the curse ignores even the flow of time
>also true
>did you name the bad guy after yourself?

S:
>Of course. "Cursed Al"
>But also, I had no intention of actually publishing the lore. It was more just to help inspire the songs
>Given that I started writing that in 2020 and last updated it in... 2020, I don't think it helped all that much

L:
>at least i now have seen the deep lore

\[...\]

## The Most Important Change I've Made
L:
>well it has a gay couple so it's really all i need in a game's lore

S:
>Really, what else does a game even need?
>I've got it! TWO gay couples

L:
>you would beat undertale with that

S:
>[[James RedawiÄ‡|James]] and Al are (former) lovers now, I've just decided.

L:
>wait no undertale has both alphys + undyne and the royal guards

S:
>Do Asgore and Rudy mean nothing to you?

L:
>thats a deltarune exclusive
>so james + al is a step in the right direction but you're gonna need even more

S:
>![[asgorudy.jpg]]

L:
>point taken

S:
>Well, there are literally only four characters right now. The entire cast is gay

L:
>does that make it a diversity win or loss?...

S:
>Lol
>Need a [[Boring Straight Greg|token cishet]]

L:
>exactly
>write them as plain as possible and also they die somewhere in the middle to advance the plot

\[...\]

S:
>Whether this will actually result in more music remains to be seen

L:
>if not i will cry

S:
>Can't promise you won't cry from the music I DO write. I mean, there's definitely going to be some dead gay people
>\+ one (1) straight guy

L:
>its ok ill make a scarcely-updated comic revolving around the main character somehow reviving all the dead people

S:
>Of course. It's your sacred duty
>It is actually giving me an idea. Not sure yet how it will translate into music. "James Still Remembers You". For some reason, I always thought the "You" was referring to Luke, but what if it's actually referring to Al?
>![[big_gay_crybaby.png]]
>I'm just going to hope that picture conveys what I mean

L:
>deep down there is a good person in side Al? Al has kick-ass rainbow wings? all characters in the story will be gay AND a furry?

S:
>D) All of the above

L:
>EXCELLENT. TRULY EXCELLENT.
