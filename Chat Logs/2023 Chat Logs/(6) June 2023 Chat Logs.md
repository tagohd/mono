>ITS HUGE

S:
>That's gotta go in MONO now

L:
>reference ALL the games

S:
>As cool as arm cannons are, maybe it should be some kind of satellite: ORBITAL ORB LAUNCHER
>Nothing saying we can't have both though
>Seems a little at odds with the fantasy vibes, though, what with the dragon and all
>Maybe there's some sort of Chrono Trigger deal going on

L:
>oh btw
>im currently writing about a [[Magic]] system i thought off
>maybe it'll fit in mono

S:
>![[starship_troopers.gif]]

L:
>you have that one on hand huh

S:
>I saved it pretty recently, so I didn't have to go too far
>But I foresee getting a lot of mileage out of it, yes

L:
>it is a good one

S:
>I do in fact desire to know more about several things
>Oh, but I've realized there's something of a major problem (maybe)

L:
>Like the taste of nuclear fusion reactors, i presume
>oh interesting do go on

S:
>MONO was originally mostly for developing musical themes. I haven't really put much thought into the other kind of themes
>But maybe that's not important since I'm not actually planning on making a real game out of it

L:
>I'm definitely going to make a spoof game out of it eventually
>as in, the very first stages of a game, until i give up
>i did already make one (1) platformer game so im semi-aware of how much work making a game is

S:
>And also maybe it's not something I need to worry about right now. But I feel like it would be better if there was actually a story I was trying to tell. Or, to paraphrase [[Big Ideas and Big Questions|the most recent note]], if I knew what it was about. Not what the plot is, but what it's *about*, ya dig?

L:
>easy, its about friendship
>as any good game

S:
>How could I have been so blind

\[...\]

L:
>i have pushed the thing

S:
>![[truly excellent.jpg]]
>Another high mileage image

S:
>Ooh, these are definitely interesting ideas... Far too interesting for nearly 06:00, unfortunately

L:
>yes go to sleep please

\[...\]

S:
>Alright, but just one more thing. For some reason I am imagining the [[Mana Plane|mana plane]] being like this:
>![[fma truth.jpeg]]
>Or maybe like this:
>![[squidward.png]]

L:
>the latter please

S:
>I'll try to keep that in mind, but something about meddling with the primal forces of nature to resurrect a dead loved one is giving me some strong Fullmetal Alchemist vibes
>
>Oh, wait. There's a thought. [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]] is still alive at the beginning of the story, but [[CURSED AL|AL]] is already trying to build the [[BFS 10000]] to resurrect him. Maybe that ties into the cyclical nature of things. And also the idea I had at the very beginning of things that James was predestined to die
>
>Maybe AL knows he can't prevent James from dying, so he's trying to resurrect him after the fact
>And AL is so obsessed with this idea that it leads to their breakup, even though he's (ostensibly) doing it out of love for James
>
>AL's like, "I love you so much that I would tear apart the fabric of the universe to keep you with me", but James is like, "AL, you idiot, we *live* in the universe!"
>
>And there's another potential FMA parallel: the [[BFS 10000]] is kinda like the giant transmutation circle, and it's going to draw on the power of everyone's [[SOUL|SOULS]].
>
>And CURSED AL is after [[Sam Ward|Sam]] because they're a ginger and therefore don't have a SOUL, so he's going to, like, focus the power of everybody's SOULS onto them and use them as a vessel or something
>Is that racist?
>
>But what makes [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] special? Why is he THE CHOSEN ONE? He's not, actually. There is no CHOSEN ONE. James just says that to everyone. The only thing that makes Luke special is that he was stupid enough to actually believe James
>
>This could also set up something of a "No, I am your father" moment when Luke first confronts AL. AL just wipes the floor with Luke (maybe it's one of those scripted battles where you're supposed to lose), and Luke says something like, "How could I have lost? I thought I was THE CHOSEN ONE." And AL's just like
>![[queen of england.jpeg]]
>"Man, that's *rich* coming from him. He says *I'm* evil, and here he is getting some *kid* to do his dirty work? How old are you anyway, 'CHOSEN ONE'? 12?"
>(Of course, it's important to note that AL's plan is, like, objectively wayyy more evil.)
>
>Oh, and this is now what CURSED AL sounds like in my head: https://youtu.be/8RtOgIgDrvk (I believe the kids call this a "voice claim"?)
>His curse is that he's allergic to electricity
>And maybe he calls James "Jimmy"

S:
>Anyway, I'm going to continue blowing up your DMs because I'm too cheap to pay $8/mo for Obsidian Sync and too lazy to figure out how to make obsidian-git work on my phone. Sorry for being weird about my OCs in your DMs. It will happen again.

>So, themes of the story:
>- The existence of fate, and the inevitability thereof
>- Fucked up ideas of enlightenment
>- Gay furries go brrr
>- Wizard Divorce or: if two wizards were in the [[mana plane]] and one killed the other with a spell, would that be fucked up or what?
