L:
>the latter please

S:
>I'll try to keep that in mind, but something about meddling with the primal forces of nature to resurrect a dead loved one is giving me some strong Fullmetal Alchemist vibes
>
>Oh, wait. There's a thought. [[James Redawić|James]] is still alive at the beginning of the story, but [[CURSED AL|AL]] is already trying to build the [[BFS 10000]] to resurrect him. Maybe that ties into the cyclical nature of things. And also the idea I had at the very beginning of things that James was predestined to die
>
>Maybe AL knows he can't prevent James from dying, so he's trying to resurrect him after the fact
>And AL is so obsessed with this idea that it leads to their breakup, even though he's (ostensibly) doing it out of love for James
>
>AL's like, "I love you so much that I would tear apart the fabric of the universe to keep you with me", but James is like, "AL, you idiot, we *live* in the universe!"
>
>And there's another potential FMA parallel: the [[BFS 10000]] is kinda like the giant transmutation circle, and it's going to draw on the power of everyone's [[SOUL|SOULS]].
>
>And CURSED AL is after [[Sam Ward|Sam]] because they're a ginger and therefore don't have a SOUL, so he's going to, like, focus the power of everybody's SOULS onto them and use them as a vessel or something
>Is that racist?
>
>But what makes [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] special? Why is he THE CHOSEN ONE? He's not, actually. There is no CHOSEN ONE. James just says that to everyone. The only thing that makes Luke special is that he was stupid enough to actually believe James
>
>This could also set up something of a "No, I am your father" moment when Luke first confronts AL. AL just wipes the floor with Luke (maybe it's one of those scripted battles where you're supposed to lose), and Luke says something like, "How could I have lost? I thought I was THE CHOSEN ONE." And AL's just like
>![[queen of england.jpeg]]
>"Man, that's *rich* coming from him. He says *I'm* evil, and here he is getting some *kid* to do his dirty work? How old are you anyway, 'CHOSEN ONE'? 12?"
>(Of course, it's important to note that AL's plan is, like, objectively wayyy more evil.)
>
>Oh, and this is now what CURSED AL sounds like in my head: https://youtu.be/8RtOgIgDrvk (I believe the kids call this a "voice claim"?)
>His curse is that he's allergic to electricity
>And maybe he calls James "Jimmy"

>Good morning! I lied about not working on it anymore. Luke has 3 moms now. But I haven't really made any other big changes. Long distance teleportation doesn't exist, but you can still "\*teleports behind you\* Nothing personnel, kid"
>I think that's about it

L:
>alright good choice but if thats the case can we have luke repeatedly mention some "dark period in his life" and "event  that changed him forever" and then it turns out he's referring to when he had to make 3 mother day's gifts in elementary school and it really stressed him out bcs he wanted all of them to be good

S:
>Yes, absolutely
>Oh, and btw, their names are Louise, Loretta, and Elizabeth (who specifically hates being called "Liz"). I have not figured out what Luke calls each of them

\[...\]

S:
>So, idk how genetics and stuff work in this world, but the way I see it, it seems like only one of Luke's moms needs to be the same species as him (or none if he's adopted, I guess). So, what if one of his moms is literally a cougar?

L:
>i feel like inventing a new working mechanism for genetics would be a bit much 
>so yes, one same species should be fine

>Wait, yeah, maybe that's a bad idea. Literal predatory lesbian
>Forget I asked

L:
>i dont see the issue
>cant anyone be "predatory"
>why does it matter that its a lesbian

S:
>Because I thought that was a stereotype. And cougar is slang for an older woman who seeks out significantly younger partners (not sure if that got lost in translation)

#Gameplay 
gameplay:: Luke refuses to ask for hints. [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs#^luke-plays-on-hard|ref]]

S:
>It'd be like when you try to ask Papyrus for a hint and he just tells you stuff you already know
>Oh, I meant that Luke refuses to call her
>You don't get any hints in this game because Luke doesn't want them

L:
>but you _can_ call your moms i hope?
>maybe its a roulette which one of the three you get on the phone...

S:
>Sure, he just won't say that he needs a hint

>luke: \*hangs up immediately\*

S:
>"Mama, I'm 16. I got this!"
>Regardless (or especially) if he does not, in fact, got this

>Nah, it's a 50/50 chance which mom you get. It's still rigged, but it's a little bit random

S:
>Oh, here's a possible way we could combine both ideas: what if the SOUL fusion reaction can only happen in a living vessel, but once it's completed, the SOULS can be safely transferred into THE ORB?

L:
> That works, but if Sam is required after the fusion, why hasn't AL killed them by the time they fight Luke?

S:
>And then we can also keep Sam not having a SOUL. AL still kidnaps them as a matter of convenience—he's not even aware they don't have a SOUL—and when he takes all the SOULS out of them, he fully expects them to just die, but joke's on him because they're used to not having a SOUL. Luke distracts AL, and Sam is like, "Surprise, muthafucka" and takes THE ORB. The rest of the scene plays out the same: Sam casts Reverse Fate, and Luke wakes up back at the beginning of the game with a weird déjà vu feeling that something is terribly wrong.

L:

S:
>You can't just shoot a SOUL into the surface of Mars
>Objective: Shoot a SOUL into the surface of Mars

L:
> This is how we exile AL

S:
>I was thinking it would be funny if Luke could sell the Artifacts, but they go straight to CURSED AL if you do. They're worth a lot of money, so the player might have an incentive to do this, and, as we've already established, Luke's an idiot, so he would go along with it. (Heh, what if it's like OneShot and Luke talks to you? "Are you sure this is a good idea, $PlayerName? Well, okay... If you say so...")

^sell-the-artifacts
#Gameplay 
gameplay:: The player is made to feel like they're taking advantage of Luke's idiocy/naïveté.

gameplay:: The player can choose to sell the Artifacts, but this has consequences.

L:
> I like the idea of AL going shopping at the black market (the owl house flavour) and just finding some of his cursed artifacts. This should be implemented.

S:
>I feel like the other characters would stop him, though. Like, you can't sell them if Case is in your party, and if James is still alive, he'll be like, "Wtf dude, go buy it back! Now!" And of course, you have to pay way more than you sold it for. The store owners are trying to make a profit, after all.

L:
> Jokes on Case as AL gets the artifacts in the end anyways. Luke is so big brain that none can understand his genious, especially not himself.

S:
>> That works, but if Sam is required after the fusion, why hasn't AL killed them by the time they fight Luke?
>
>He assumes they're dead by virtue of no longer having a SOUL in them?

L:
> But isn't Sam required to be at the fight with Luke for your ending to be able to take place? Then AL would have to do the SOUL fusing, Orb transferring and Staff making all right before the fight. Or Sam just plays dead for a really long time and AL is like "someone should really come get rid of this corpse its been here for 2 weeks. I wont do it though."

S:
>> I guess you really like the BFS 10000, huh. It certainly looks cool enough!

>You mean because I already changed the name everywhere? It automatically updated when I changed the name of the file, which was my intent. (Didn't want to bother with Atom, so I just added an alias and searched for the unlinked mentions.) I think it's a more fitting name than SOUL AMPLIFIER, since it basically is a Big Fucking SOUL.

>Oh, yeah, I guess I'm going to have to figure out how that happens. How does AL end up with the Artifacts if they're supposed to be in the possession of either Luke or James?

L:
> Luke keeps them in his inventory like an idiot and AL just kinda snatches them? Maybe he pulls some cheap trick on Luke and he, of course, falls for it. Or he sends someone to take it from him. In the loop where James doesn't get killed (if were doing that), James could set it up so Luke loses the artefacts to AL, but if James is dead I imagine it's just some good old Luke Stupidity at work

S:
> sudo:: Maybe that could be combined with the scripted loss? AL wipes the floor with Luke AND takes the Artifacts from him. I'll also expand on this in the part where I mentioned the choices the player has with the Artifacts (I don't remember which article that was right now).
