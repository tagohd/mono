>Oh, wait. There's a thought. [[James Redawić|James]] is still alive at the beginning of the story, but [[CURSED AL|AL]] is already trying to build the [[BFS 10000]] to resurrect him.

>And there's another potential FMA parallel: the [[BFS 10000]] is kinda like the giant transmutation circle, and it's going to draw on the power of everyone's [[SOUL|SOULS]].

>And CURSED AL is after [[Sam Ward|Sam]] because they're a ginger and therefore don't have a SOUL, so he's going to, like, focus the power of everybody's SOULS onto them and use them as a vessel or something
>Is that racist?
>
>But what makes [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] special? Why is he THE CHOSEN ONE? He's not, actually. There is no CHOSEN ONE. James just says that to everyone. The only thing that makes Luke special is that he was stupid enough to actually believe James
>
>This could also set up something of a "No, I am your father" moment when Luke first confronts AL. AL just wipes the floor with Luke (maybe it's one of those scripted battles where you're supposed to lose), and Luke says something like, "How could I have lost? I thought I was THE CHOSEN ONE." And AL's just like

>Oh, here's a possible way we could combine both ideas: what if the SOUL fusion reaction can only happen in a living vessel, but once it's completed, the SOULS can be safely transferred into THE ORB?

L:
> That works, but if Sam is required after the fusion, why hasn't AL killed them by the time they fight Luke?

AL still kidnaps them as a matter of convenience—he's not even aware they don't have a SOUL—and when he takes all the SOULS out of them, he fully expects them to just die, but joke's on him because they're used to not having a SOUL. Luke distracts AL, and Sam is like, "Surprise, muthafucka" and takes THE ORB. The rest of the scene plays out the same: Sam casts Reverse Fate, and Luke wakes up back at the beginning of the game with a weird déjà vu feeling that something is terribly wrong.

James is in a lot of pain/still hasn't gotten over suddenly being disabled after spending two centuries not being disabled, and then we go "But look! All these other disabled characters are thriving! You don't have to kill yourself!" and the true ending is "everybody lives", but I feel like that cheapens the situations of real people who are seeking assisted suicide. Plus, I'm not sure I could write it so that it comes across as "assisted suicide is okay" and not "if you're disabled you should just kys"
>I mean, I probably could, but I'm also worried about willful misinterpretation. Perhaps it's better not to even open myself up to that. (Especially if my target audience is the "piss on the poor" reading comprehension website)
>It's irrelevant anyway. Obviously, the TRUE true ending involves convincing Pauline that Edna is not going to eat her

S:
>Not sure if this really solves anything, but I was thinking it would be kind of a funny subversion if Luke straight up refused to do what you told him sometimes because not only is he a video game protagonist, but he's also a dog(boy), so he should be particularly inclined to follow orders

L:
>should be inclinced to follow orders or shouldn't be??
>also, idea for repo organization: maybe just have one big working file with active discussions sorted by file (with headers so you can easily navigate) and when we figure something out we update the file itself? and maybe archive the discussions somewhere at the bottom of the file?
>so pretty much all updates/replies happen there and you just browse that file because either that person replied (discussion ongoing) or updated the file itself (peer review completed)
>possible problems:
>- file becomes way too big
>- not easy when you just wanna add something to a file but its not really for discussion? (like a new song or age of a character of whatever)
>- what when you just make a new file
>i guess it can work in tandem with the current system?

S:
>Should be, but isn't. Perhaps he's not very well trained
>That's kinda what I'm doing with the Talk folder? At least, moving finished discussions there and keeping ongoing ones in the current files, but, yeah, one file for all discussions could end up rather large
>Maybe we should tag the ones that are actively being worked on/have issues that still need to be addressed? Which is also kinda what I was trying to do with the Focus tags
>Though in at least one case, I actually started a new discussion in the talk page for James
>We still need to figure out what _he_ wants to do with the Artifacts, but maybe that will be easier to solve when we figure out what the Artifacts are actually capable of

L:
>oh ok, somehow missed the "subversion" part
>some dogs are like that though
>a fair number of them id dare say

S:
>This is true
>Maybe that's a bit of a mischaracterization, actually. I feel like "willfully disobeying commands" is a trait more commonly associated with smarter dogs, but I guess it also depends on how you define dog intelligence

L:
>with the chocolate orb scene in rhapsody we _have_ already established that he's a whats-that-in-your-mouth-(pause)-NO! kinda dogboy

S:
>Lol
>There is one other problem, though: having him refuse to follow the player's commands might potentially conflict with the idea that he's supposed to be naïve/overly trusting, unless it's something that only happens later in the game. Maybe after he finds out that James lied to him? All this assumes that we're even acknowledging the player as a separate entity, which is still yet to be decided

S:
>Hmmm, maybe the player isn't directly acknowledged (at least at first), and Luke instead refers to them as "\[his\] instincts" or "this voice inside \[his\] head that tells \[him\] what to do"
>And maybe whenever there's a choice, one of the options represents Luke's choice? Might not even be explicitly called such—could just be the default option  
>Importantly, it's not necessarily the correct choice

#Gameplay 
vnViable:: The game tracks how often you make the same choice Luke would have made. However, Luke is an idiot, so the choices he would make aren't necessarily the right ones, so the game also tracks that. If both variables are too high, Luke may stop listening to the player.

L:
[^Re: suprise-mf.gif]
>elaboration on that: Typically, having your SOUL absorbed by the ARTIFICIAL SOUL (we need a catchier name for this) will kill your mind / have you in a plant-like state so you pretty much cant do anything anymore. Since Sam is actually used to living without a SOUL, they slowly wake up from the poison and are like "well this is new", but still can't really escape or do much because of the poison. Then when Luke calls out to Sam they can actually hear him (since AL has most of Sam's SOUL and Luke somehow talked directly to the SOUL?). Then Sam is able to cast Reverse Fate because one of the fused SOULs knew how to (???)
>Also when AL is like "foolish child, your friend's SOUL has already been absorbed by the ARTIFICIAL SOUL i put inside them", Luke goes "you gave THEM A SOUL?!" (AL starts SWEATING)

S:

>But somehow still connected to Sam?

L:
>they still have enough in them to keep the SOUL stable
>its a bit complicated atm

S:
>Hmmm, I think that actually makes sense. The SOULMALGAMATION (no, that's not a great name, either) can't exist if it's not connected to a living vessel, but you can't use it if it's still in someone

> Hmmm, well, the way I've written it now, maybe it's not so much that Sam doesn't know how to cast Reverse Fate, just that ordinarily it requires so much mana that it's impossible to cast without your SOUL exploding
> Disregarding the fact that they don't have a SOUL to explode

L:
> oh i was talking about James

S:
> Yeah, I was just thinking maybe we don't need to have James in the ÜBERSOUL after all

L:
>so anyone can cast any spell given enough mana?

S:
>![[I GUESS.png]]
>I mean, that kinda fits with what I wrote about Luke not being THE CHOSEN ONE
>It's just that more powerful spells require mana in amounts that are liable to fry your SOUL

L:
> but then the whole idea of Luke learning spells from James is also gone
> all he needs is a bigger SOUL?

S:
>Shit

L:
> how do you even get better at magic if that's the system
> i think this introduces a lot more problems than having James in the ÜBERSOUL

S:
> Yeah
> But, there's nothing inherent to Luke that makes him THE CHOSEN ONE
> Anyone can cast any spell, but I guess you still have to know how

L:
> yeah, and its sam casting the spell anyway

S:
> This is true

L:
>james is just the ps5 in his head telling him how to
>i guess he could also ask sam to ressurect him, but it would be more difficult to convince them

L:
[^Re: also, could he resurrect himself from the orb instead of casting reverse fate, given that he can cast a spell like reverse fate?]
> so if its actually sam casting the spell this problem is gone

S:
> Maybe they're not directly communicating with James. It's just by virtue of him being in there that they have access to his knowledge, including how to cast Reverse Fate
> James doesn't get a say in how they use that knowledge

L:
> ok but what if all they can hear ALL the SOULs and its driving them a bit crazy
> which is another big reason you dont want to put the UBERSOUL into yourself, but have a vessel

S:
> Maybe that's why they end up erasing themself from the timeline
> Wasn't intentional

L:
>_im done with this shit bro_

S:
>Or that

L:
> so is sam like gone gone from the story then

S:
> I cast STFU
> No, but I have no idea how they're coming back
> I mean, if Luke still kinda remembers them, then they obviously didn't erase themself completely

L:
> i think we can do some real time loop fuckery with making the reason Sam doesnt have a SOUL in the first loop is because they erased themselves incompletely and luke could only bring them back without a SOUL

S:
> Ooooh

L:
> which currently makes no sense, and maybe never will. but that time loop fuckery for you

S:
> Wait, but the only reason they're able to go "Surprise muthafucka" on AL is because they don't have a SOUL
> But I guess: time loop

L:

S:

> Sorry to interrupt, but: BFS thread jumpscare
>>Even though ÜBERSOULS formed in living vessels are more stable, they aren't usable while still in the vessel's body. You will need to use [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]] to transfer the ÜBERSOUL into a more appropriate container, such as [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]].
>so is the ubersoul completely taken out of the vessel?

S:
> Oh, I meant to include that it's still (loosely) attached to the vessel

L:

### THREAD "MATH"
S:

>Okay, so here's what I have so far:
> - Ejiofor's constant ($E$): 6.3459269958 - A number I made up to make the mana costs be less big
> - Stokoff's constant ($S$): 39.810686024 - Another number I made up just for the fuck of it
> - Ejiofor's limit ($L_E$): 1.21 PEj ($1.21 \times 10^{15}$ Ej) - The amount of mana a SOUL can take in one dose before it just straight up explodes or something, independent of the user's tolerance
> - Gustav's number ($G$): 19.4646 ZEj ($19.4646 \times 10^{21}$ Ej) - The amount of free mana that can be in the atmosphere before Really Bad Things (TM) happen
> - Avogadro's number ($N_A$): $6.02214076 \times 10^{23}$ - Idk, just felt like it should be involved somehow
> - Euler's number ($e$): 2.718281828...

%% That's kinda hard to read, so I'm rewriting it as a table %%

| Name | Symbol | Quantity | Purpose |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Ejiofor's constant | $E$ | 6.3459269958 | A number I made up to make the mana costs be less big |
| Stokoff's constant | $S$ | 39.810686024 | Another number I made up just for the fuck of it |
| Ejiofor's limit | $L_E$ | 1.21 PEj ($1.21 \times 10^{15}$ Ej) | The amount of mana a SOUL can take in one dose before it just straight up explodes or something, independent of the user's tolerance |
| Gustav's number | $G$ | 19.4646 ZEj ($19.4646 \times 10^{21}$ Ej) | The amount of free mana that can be in the atmosphere before Really Bad Things (TM) happen
| Avogadro's number | $N_A$ | $6.02214076 \times 10^{23}$ | Idk, just felt like it should be involved somehow |
| Euler's number | $e$ | 2.718281828 | |

S:
> Oh, and the Stokoff maximum, the theory that an ÜBERSOUL can't contain more than 13 SOULS or it will implode
> Which would also cause Really Bad Things (TM) to happen
> And then there's the formula for calculating the minimum mana cost of a given spell of known level
> $$m = \frac{e^{3l}}{E} \times 1000$$
> That's strictly more than 13, btw. It can contain exactly 13 SOULS and be fine
