>Oh, wait. There's a thought. [[James Redawić|James]] is still alive at the beginning of the story, but [[CURSED AL|AL]] is already trying to build the [[BFS 10000]] to resurrect him. Maybe that ties into the cyclical nature of things. And also the idea I had at the very beginning of things that James was predestined to die

>AL's like, "I love you so much that I would tear apart the fabric of the universe to keep you with me", but James is like, "AL, you idiot, we *live* in the universe!"

>And there's another potential FMA parallel: the [[BFS 10000]] is kinda like the giant transmutation circle, and it's going to draw on the power of everyone's [[SOUL|SOULS]].
>
>And CURSED AL is after [[Sam Ward|Sam]] because they're a ginger and therefore don't have a SOUL, so he's going to, like, focus the power of everybody's SOULS onto them and use them as a vessel or something
>Is that racist?
>
>But what makes [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] special? Why is he THE CHOSEN ONE? He's not, actually. There is no CHOSEN ONE. James just says that to everyone. The only thing that makes Luke special is that he was stupid enough to actually believe James
>
>This could also set up something of a "No, I am your father" moment when Luke first confronts AL. AL just wipes the floor with Luke (maybe it's one of those scripted battles where you're supposed to lose), and Luke says something like, "How could I have lost? I thought I was THE CHOSEN ONE." And AL's just like
>![[queen of england.jpeg]]
>"Man, that's *rich* coming from him. He says *I'm* evil, and here he is getting some *kid* to do his dirty work? How old are you anyway, 'CHOSEN ONE'? 12?"
>(Of course, it's important to note that AL's plan is, like, objectively wayyy more evil.)

>Oh, and this is now what CURSED AL sounds like in my head: https://youtu.be/8RtOgIgDrvk (I believe the kids call this a "voice claim"?)

S:
>Oh, here's a possible way we could combine both ideas: what if the SOUL fusion reaction can only happen in a living vessel, but once it's completed, the SOULS can be safely transferred into THE ORB?

L:
> That works, but if Sam is required after the fusion, why hasn't AL killed them by the time they fight Luke?

S:
>And then we can also keep Sam not having a SOUL. AL still kidnaps them as a matter of convenience—he's not even aware they don't have a SOUL—and when he takes all the SOULS out of them, he fully expects them to just die, but joke's on him because they're used to not having a SOUL. Luke distracts AL, and Sam is like, "Surprise, muthafucka" and takes THE ORB. The rest of the scene plays out the same: Sam casts Reverse Fate, and Luke wakes up back at the beginning of the game with a weird déjà vu feeling that something is terribly wrong.

S:
>I was thinking it would be funny if Luke could sell the Artifacts, but they go straight to CURSED AL if you do. They're worth a lot of money, so the player might have an incentive to do this, and, as we've already established, Luke's an idiot, so he would go along with it. (Heh, what if it's like OneShot and Luke talks to you? "Are you sure this is a good idea, $PlayerName? Well, okay... If you say so...") ^sell-the-artifacts

#Gameplay 

gameplay:: "The player is made to feel like they're taking advantage of Luke's idiocy/naïveté.", "The player can choose to sell the Artifacts, but this has consequences. ([[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs#^sell-the-artifacts|ref]])"

L:
> I like the idea of AL going shopping at the black market (the owl house flavour) and just finding some of his cursed artifacts. This should be implemented.

S:
>I feel like the other characters would stop him, though. Like, you can't sell them if Case is in your party, and if James is still alive, he'll be like, "Wtf dude, go buy it back! Now!" And of course, you have to pay way more than you sold it for. The store owners are trying to make a profit, after all.

L:

S:
>> That works, but if Sam is required after the fusion, why hasn't AL killed them by the time they fight Luke?

>He assumes they're dead by virtue of no longer having a SOUL in them?

L:
> But isn't Sam required to be at the fight with Luke for your ending to be able to take place? Then AL would have to do the SOUL fusing, Orb transferring and Staff making all right before the fight. Or Sam just plays dead for a really long time and AL is like "someone should really come get rid of this corpse its been here for 2 weeks. I wont do it though."

> Luke keeps them in his inventory like an idiot and AL just kinda snatches them? Maybe he pulls some cheap trick on Luke and he, of course, falls for it. Or he sends someone to take it from him. In the loop where James doesn't get killed (if were doing that), James could set it up so Luke loses the artefacts to AL, but if James is dead I imagine it's just some good old Luke Stupidity at work

S:

Unless I've made a fundamental misunderstanding of how the magic system works, but you didn't correct me, so I'm hoping I didn't.

>And James doesn't even want revenge. He wants to build his own BFS 10K because he *can't* die otherwise. (Either he doesn't know that Longevity didn't work, or it actually did work)
>Yeah, you know what, I don't think I want to do that. I was thinking what if it's a "right to die" situation. James is in a lot of pain/still hasn't gotten over suddenly being disabled after spending two centuries not being disabled, and then we go "But look! All these other disabled characters are thriving! You don't have to kill yourself!" and the true ending is "everybody lives", but I feel like that cheapens the situations of real people who are seeking assisted suicide. Plus, I'm not sure I could write it so that it comes across as "assisted suicide is okay" and not "if you're disabled you should just kys"
>I mean, I probably could, but I'm also worried about willful misinterpretation. Perhaps it's better not to even open myself up to that. (Especially if my target audience is the "piss on the poor" reading comprehension website)
>It's irrelevant anyway. Obviously, the TRUE true ending involves convincing Pauline that Edna is not going to eat her

S:
>Not sure if this really solves anything, but I was thinking it would be kind of a funny subversion if Luke straight up refused to do what you told him sometimes because not only is he a video game protagonist, but he's also a dog(boy), so he should be particularly inclined to follow orders

L:
>should be inclinced to follow orders or shouldn't be??
>also, idea for repo organization: maybe just have one big working file with active discussions sorted by file (with headers so you can easily navigate) and when we figure something out we update the file itself? and maybe archive the discussions somewhere at the bottom of the file?
>so pretty much all updates/replies happen there and you just browse that file because either that person replied (discussion ongoing) or updated the file itself (peer review completed)
>possible problems:
>- file becomes way too big
>- not easy when you just wanna add something to a file but its not really for discussion? (like a new song or age of a character of whatever)
>- what when you just make a new file
>i guess it can work in tandem with the current system?

S:
>Should be, but isn't. Perhaps he's not very well trained
>That's kinda what I'm doing with the Talk folder? At least, moving finished discussions there and keeping ongoing ones in the current files, but, yeah, one file for all discussions could end up rather large
>Maybe we should tag the ones that are actively being worked on/have issues that still need to be addressed? Which is also kinda what I was trying to do with the Focus tags
>Though in at least one case, I actually started a new discussion in the talk page for James
>We still need to figure out what _he_ wants to do with the Artifacts, but maybe that will be easier to solve when we figure out what the Artifacts are actually capable of

L:
>oh ok, somehow missed the "subversion" part
>some dogs are like that though
>a fair number of them id dare say

S:
>This is true
>Maybe that's a bit of a mischaracterization, actually. I feel like "willfully disobeying commands" is a trait more commonly associated with smarter dogs, but I guess it also depends on how you define dog intelligence

L:
>with the chocolate orb scene in rhapsody we _have_ already established that he's a whats-that-in-your-mouth-(pause)-NO! kinda dogboy

S:
>Lol
>There is one other problem, though: having him refuse to follow the player's commands might potentially conflict with the idea that he's supposed to be naïve/overly trusting, unless it's something that only happens later in the game. Maybe after he finds out that James lied to him? All this assumes that we're even acknowledging the player as a separate entity, which is still yet to be decided

S:
>Hmmm, maybe the player isn't directly acknowledged (at least at first), and Luke instead refers to them as "\[his\] instincts" or "this voice inside \[his\] head that tells \[him\] what to do"
>And maybe whenever there's a choice, one of the options represents Luke's choice? Might not even be explicitly called such—could just be the default option  
>Importantly, it's not necessarily the correct choice
>But it could be something the game keeps track of: how many times your choice aligned with what Luke would have chosen
>If timesPlayerDisagreedWithLuke > x AND timesPlayerMadeObjectivelyBadChoices > y then Luke might stop listening to you
>But if Luke is the one making the bad choices (or thinks that he is), then...
>Idk
>He gets depressed?
>I feel like either way he's going to have some sort of existential crisis

S:
[^Re: also, idea for repo organization: maybe just have one big working file with active discussions sorted by file (with headers so you can easily navigate) and when we figure something out we update the file itself? and maybe arch]
>Oh, I think I might have misunderstood that at first. So, the notes themselves are basically canon, and the discussions are held in a separate document until we decide the discussion is closed
>Uh... might be able to do that
>Almost feels like it might be easier to just create a second vault?
>Maybe not. Not sure you can link files across multiple vaults

\[2.5 hours later\]

S:
>oh my god cleaning up all the files to _only_ have canon stuff is so much work

S:
>Just had an idea for why James needs the Artifacts
>The repeated failures to cast Longevity reduced James's tolerance of Mana, so he needs the BFS 10000 to be able to cast a really powerful spell
>What spell?
>Wizard Divorce
>They weren't just gay married. They were gay wizard married. Gay evil wizard married, no less
>There's no "'til death do us part" in those vows (especially since they weren't planning on dying)
>Even though AL was declared dead in absentia, they're still technically married
>James has to cast Wizard Divorce to sever their matrimonial bonds permanently
>(It doesn't matter that he's also married to Grigori. We've already established that there are no laws against bigamy with the Mothers Campbell.)

S:
[^Re: Er, sting you in the ass]
>He just won't do it if he doesn't trust you, so it's gg
>Idk how that works actually. I guess AL gets to the BEE first?

L:
[^Re: suprise-mf.gif]
>elaboration on that: Typically, having your SOUL absorbed by the ARTIFICIAL SOUL (we need a catchier name for this) will kill your mind / have you in a plant-like state so you pretty much cant do anything anymore. Since Sam is actually used to living without a SOUL, they slowly wake up from the poison and are like "well this is new", but still can't really escape or do much because of the poison. Then when Luke calls out to Sam they can actually hear him (since AL has most of Sam's SOUL and Luke somehow talked directly to the SOUL?). Then Sam is able to cast Reverse Fate because one of the fused SOULs knew how to (???)
>Also when AL is like "foolish child, your friend's SOUL has already been absorbed by the ARTIFICIAL SOUL i put inside them", Luke goes "you gave THEM A SOUL?!" (AL starts SWEATING)

S:
>>Sam is actually used to living without a SOUL
>>AL has most of Sam's SOUL
>What

L:
>AL has most of the SOUL he just gave to Sam
>it's his now
>theirs

S:
>Oh, so they're like a hivemind kinda thing?
>They're sharing the SOUL?
>Unintentionally

L:
>well its mostly in the ORB at that point

S:
>But somehow still connected to Sam?

L:
>they still have enough in them to keep the SOUL stable
>its a bit complicated atm

S:
>Hmmm, I think that actually makes sense. The SOULMALGAMATION (no, that's not a great name, either) can't exist if it's not connected to a living vessel, but you can't use it if it's still in someone

L:
>unless we go with the cloud computer line and the SOUL is entirely inside Sam, AL is just able to send Mana into it

S:
>>Then Sam is able to cast Reverse Fate because one of the fused SOULs knew how to (???)
>What if one of the SOULS belonged to James?

L:
>oh shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit

S:
[^Re: unless we go with the cloud computer line and the SOUL is entirely inside Sam, AL is just able to send Mana into it]

>(artificial soul, im workshopping here)
>unless Luke also has the ORB at that point

S:
>Uh... it gets sucked into THE BLADE? And you need the NEEDLE to get it out?

L:
>the sword is also a soul container now?!

S:
>It only holds one SOUL at a time

L:
>but then how does it get into the SOUL2.0

S:
>You kill someone with the sword and their SOUL goes ZORP and it gets sucked in

L:
>ohhh

S:
>Then you use the NEEDLE to get it out

L:
>yeah that makes sense
>how do you use a needle on a sword though...
>in any case, when AL starts collecting SOULs into the ORB he's then like "oh theres one already in here, how convenient" and slaps it in

S:
>The SOUL goes ZORP and it gets sucked into the NEEDLE?
>Idk, fuckin capillary action or something

L:
>capillary action is always the answer

S:
>You just hold the NEEDLE near the ENSOULED SWORD and it goes SCHLOOP
