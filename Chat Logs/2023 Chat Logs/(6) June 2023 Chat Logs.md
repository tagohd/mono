S:
>I'll try to keep that in mind, but something about meddling with the primal forces of nature to resurrect a dead loved one is giving me some strong Fullmetal Alchemist vibes
>
>Oh, wait. There's a thought. [[James Redawić|James]] is still alive at the beginning of the story, but [[CURSED AL|AL]] is already trying to build the [[BFS 10000]] to resurrect him. Maybe that ties into the cyclical nature of things. And also the idea I had at the very beginning of things that James was predestined to die

>Maybe AL knows he can't prevent James from dying, so he's trying to resurrect him after the fact
>And AL is so obsessed with this idea that it leads to their breakup, even though he's (ostensibly) doing it out of love for James
>
>AL's like, "I love you so much that I would tear apart the fabric of the universe to keep you with me", but James is like, "AL, you idiot, we *live* in the universe!"
>
>And there's another potential FMA parallel: the [[BFS 10000]] is kinda like the giant transmutation circle, and it's going to draw on the power of everyone's [[SOUL|SOULS]].
>
>And CURSED AL is after [[Sam Ward|Sam]] because they're a ginger and therefore don't have a SOUL, so he's going to, like, focus the power of everybody's SOULS onto them and use them as a vessel or something
>Is that racist?
>
>But what makes [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] special? Why is he THE CHOSEN ONE? He's not, actually. There is no CHOSEN ONE. James just says that to everyone. The only thing that makes Luke special is that he was stupid enough to actually believe James
>
>This could also set up something of a "No, I am your father" moment when Luke first confronts AL. AL just wipes the floor with Luke (maybe it's one of those scripted battles where you're supposed to lose), and Luke says something like, "How could I have lost? I thought I was THE CHOSEN ONE." And AL's just like
>![[queen of england.jpeg]]
>"Man, that's *rich* coming from him. He says *I'm* evil, and here he is getting some *kid* to do his dirty work? How old are you anyway, 'CHOSEN ONE'? 12?"
>(Of course, it's important to note that AL's plan is, like, objectively wayyy more evil.)
>
>Oh, and this is now what CURSED AL sounds like in my head: https://youtu.be/8RtOgIgDrvk (I believe the kids call this a "voice claim"?)
>His curse is that he's allergic to electricity

L:
>alright good choice but if thats the case can we have luke repeatedly mention some "dark period in his life" and "event  that changed him forever" and then it turns out he's referring to when he had to make 3 mother day's gifts in elementary school and it really stressed him out bcs he wanted all of them to be good

S:

S:
>Oh, here's a possible way we could combine both ideas: what if the SOUL fusion reaction can only happen in a living vessel, but once it's completed, the SOULS can be safely transferred into THE ORB?

L:
> That works, but if Sam is required after the fusion, why hasn't AL killed them by the time they fight Luke?

S:
>And then we can also keep Sam not having a SOUL. AL still kidnaps them as a matter of convenience—he's not even aware they don't have a SOUL—and when he takes all the SOULS out of them, he fully expects them to just die, but joke's on him because they're used to not having a SOUL. Luke distracts AL, and Sam is like, "Surprise, muthafucka" and takes THE ORB. The rest of the scene plays out the same: Sam casts Reverse Fate, and Luke wakes up back at the beginning of the game with a weird déjà vu feeling that something is terribly wrong.

S:
>I was thinking it would be funny if Luke could sell the Artifacts, but they go straight to CURSED AL if you do. They're worth a lot of money, so the player might have an incentive to do this, and, as we've already established, Luke's an idiot, so he would go along with it. (Heh, what if it's like OneShot and Luke talks to you? "Are you sure this is a good idea, $PlayerName? Well, okay... If you say so...") ^sell-the-artifacts

#Gameplay 

gameplay:: "The player is made to feel like they're taking advantage of Luke's idiocy/naïveté.", "The player can choose to sell the Artifacts, but this has consequences. ([[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs#^sell-the-artifacts|ref]])"

L:
> I like the idea of AL going shopping at the black market (the owl house flavour) and just finding some of his cursed artifacts. This should be implemented.

S:
>I feel like the other characters would stop him, though. Like, you can't sell them if Case is in your party, and if James is still alive, he'll be like, "Wtf dude, go buy it back! Now!" And of course, you have to pay way more than you sold it for. The store owners are trying to make a profit, after all.

L:
> Jokes on Case as AL gets the artifacts in the end anyways. Luke is so big brain that none can understand his genious, especially not himself.

# 2023-06-15
S:
>> That works, but if Sam is required after the fusion, why hasn't AL killed them by the time they fight Luke?
>
>He assumes they're dead by virtue of no longer having a SOUL in them?

L:
> But isn't Sam required to be at the fight with Luke for your ending to be able to take place? Then AL would have to do the SOUL fusing, Orb transferring and Staff making all right before the fight. Or Sam just plays dead for a really long time and AL is like "someone should really come get rid of this corpse its been here for 2 weeks. I wont do it though."

S:
>> I guess you really like the BFS 10000, huh. It certainly looks cool enough!

>You mean because I already changed the name everywhere? It automatically updated when I changed the name of the file, which was my intent.

L:
> Luke keeps them in his inventory like an idiot and AL just kinda snatches them? Maybe he pulls some cheap trick on Luke and he, of course, falls for it. Or he sends someone to take it from him. In the loop where James doesn't get killed (if were doing that), James could set it up so Luke loses the artefacts to AL, but if James is dead I imagine it's just some good old Luke Stupidity at work

S:

Unless I've made a fundamental misunderstanding of how the magic system works, but you didn't correct me, so I'm hoping I didn't.
