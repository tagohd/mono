# Before the Story
## 19th Century
Sudo: If [[CURSED AL]] is the one who invented the spell, maybe it should involve his [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|ORB]] instead of some rando's [[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH|CHALICE]].

< Lun | Oooh, what if [[Longevity (Spell)]] sets a sort of "death countdown" when casting it, and when it runs out (i.e. the magic used in the casting runs out), you die / brutally implode. Normally this is a _very long_ countdown, but something went wrong while casting Longevity on James and he got a much shorter duration (still a few centuries, but not the usual millennia). Also gives AL another reason to be so obsessed with saving James: he essentially caused his impending doom by messing up the spell.

Sudo: Maybe I should make them a couple hundred years older, huh? Also, I like this idea, but it seems to conflict with Luke being the one to kill James. (I have been kind of rethinking that, though. James is useful to keep around because who else is going to teach Luke new spells? At the very least, Luke probably kills him later than I initially intended, in which case he's not like Toriel.) ^3d7c01

Lun: Alright hear me out on this one. What if [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]] gets killed in the first loop, which causes AL to successfully collect all parts of the [[BFS 10000|SOUL AMPLIFIER]], get in a big final fight with [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] and then get RESET on by [[Sam Ward|Sam]]. In the next loop however, Luke does _not_ kill James (not sure how this comes to be, maybe his sense of "something is wrong" makes him act more carefully?). This allows Luke to learn more advanced magic in the next loop and also changes the final boss fight to James, as he kills AL and takes the [[BFS 10000|SOUL AMPLIFIER]] if he survives.

Sudo: Hmmm... very, very interesting. I like it.

Lun: :D
