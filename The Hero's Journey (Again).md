## Departure/Separation
### The Call to Adventure
The hero begins in a situation of normality from which some information is received that acts as a call to head off into the unknown.

#### MONO
[[Luke Campbell]] is a fairly normal guy. He lives in a sleepy little farming town called [[Genton]], where he helps [[Ma & Pa Campbell|his parents]] out on their farm. (What do they grow? And if everyone's some kind of animal-person, do they still eat meat?) He's 16. He runs cross-country for his high school, and he hates it. He's never been particularly interested in sports, but given that Genton is a small, mostly rural town, high school football is kinda the main event; consequently, Luke doesn't fit in all that well.

What would he rather do instead? Maybe he's more of a theater kid? Whatever it is, it's something he feels he can't do in Genton. (It might also be good if it's something that ends up being relevant to his quest.) Maybe he feels he just can't be himself here. (This is more just a side-effect of being 16. You might think because it's a farming town that Genton isn't very accepting, but they're actually quite progressive. I mean, they'd have to be if everyone in the story is queer, unless we're just saying only the main characters are queer.) I think his big thing is just that he wants to do something that feels meaningful. If he stays here in Genton, his options are basically: farmer or maybe mechanic.

So, what's the call to adventure? He wakes up one morning, takes care of his farm chores, and goes next door to [[Sam Ward|Sam's]] house to run with them. Sam is also on the cross-country team, but they're actually into it. Actually, maybe they would be the one coming to Luke's house since Luke hates cross-country. (It probably goes without saying, but Sam is the only reason Luke joined the team.) So, when they don't show up to force Luke to exercise, Luke gets worried and goes over to their house to investigate. That's when he discovers that they've disappeared.

### Refusal of the Call
Often when the call is given, the future hero first refuses to heed it. This may be from a sense of duty or obligation, fear, insecurity, a sense of inadequacy, or any of a range of reasons that work to hold the person in his current circumstances.

### Supernatural Aid
Once the hero has committed to the quest, consciously or unconsciously, their guide and magical helper appears or becomes known. More often than not, this supernatural mentor will present the hero with one or more talismans or artifacts that will aid them later in their quest.

### The Crossing of the First Threshold
This is the point where the hero actually crosses into the field of adventure, leaving the known limits of their world and venturing into an unknown and dangerous realm where the rules and limits are unknown.

### Belly of the Whale
The belly of the whale represents the final separation from the hero's known world and self. By entering this stage, the person shows a willingness to undergo a metamorphosis. When first entering the stage the hero may encounter a minor danger or setback.

## Initiation
### The Road of Trials
The road of trials is a series of tests that the hero must undergo to begin the transformation. Often the hero fails one or more of these tests, which often occur in threes. Eventually, the hero will overcome these trials and move on to the next step.

### The Meeting with the Goddess
This is where the hero gains items given to him that will help him in the future.

### Woman as the Temptress
In this step, the hero faces those temptations, often of a physical or pleasurable nature, that may lead them to abandon or stray from their quest, which does not necessarily have to be represented by a woman. A woman is a metaphor for the physical or material temptations of life since the hero-knight was often tempted by lust from his spiritual journey.

### Atonement with the Father
In this step, the hero must confront and be initiated by whatever holds the ultimate power in their life. In many myths and stories, this is the father or a father figure who has life and death power. This is the center point of the journey. All the previous steps have been moving into this place, all that follow will move out from it. Although this step is most frequently symbolized by an encounter with a male entity, it does not have to be a male—just someone or something with incredible power.

### Apotheosis
This is the point of realization in which a greater understanding is achieved. Armed with this new knowledge and perception, the hero is resolved and ready for the more difficult part of the adventure.

## Return
### The Ultimate Boon
The ultimate boon is the achievement of the goal of the quest. It is what the hero went on the journey to get. All the previous steps serve to prepare and purify the hero for this step since in many myths the boon is something transcendent like the elixir of life itself, or a plant that supplies immortality, or the holy grail.

### Refusal of the Return
Having found bliss and enlightenment in the other world, the hero may not want to return to the ordinary world to bestow the boon onto their fellow beings.

### The Magic Flight
Sometimes the hero must escape with the boon if it is something that the gods have been jealously guarding. It can be just as adventurous and dangerous returning from the journey as it was to go on it.

### Rescue from Without
Just as the hero may need guides and assistants to set out on the quest, often they must have powerful guides and rescuers to bring them back to everyday life, especially if the hero has been wounded or weakened by the experience.

### The Crossing of the Return Threshold
Campbell says in _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ that "The returning hero, to complete his adventure, must survive the impact of the world." The goal of the return is to retain the wisdom gained on the quest and to integrate it into society.

### Master of the Two Worlds
For a human hero, it may mean achieving a balance between the material and spiritual. The person has become comfortable and competent in both the inner and outer worlds.

### Freedom to Live
In this step, mastery leads to freedom from the fear of death, which in turn is the freedom to live. This is sometimes referred to as living in the moment, neither anticipating the future nor regretting the past.

## Departure
### Ordinary World
We see the hero’s normal life at the start of the story before the adventure begins.

Luke Skywalker is living a normal and humble life as a farm boy on his home planet of Tatooine.

### Call to Adventure
The hero is faced with an event, conflict, problem, or challenge that makes them begin their adventure.

Luke is called to his adventure by two individuals — R2-D2 and Ben Kenobi. Luke triggers R2-D2’s message from Princess Leia and is intrigued by her and the message.

When R2-D2 escapes to find Ben Kenobi, Luke follows and is later saved by Kenobi, who goes on to tell Luke about his Jedi heritage. Kenobi suggests that he should come with him to Alderaan.

### Refusal of the Call
The hero initially refuses the adventure because of hesitation, fears, insecurity, or any other number of issues.

Luke refuses Kenobi, telling him that he can take Kenobi and the droids as far as Mos Eisley Spaceport — but he can’t possibly leave his Aunt and Uncle behind for some space adventure.

### Meeting with the Mentor
The hero encounters a mentor that can give them advice, wisdom, information, or items that ready them for the journey ahead.

\[Combined with "Call to Adventure"?]

### Crossing the (First) Threshold
The hero leaves their ordinary world for the first time and crosses the threshold into adventure.

When Luke discovers that the stormtroopers searching for the droids would track them to his farm, he rushes to warn his Aunt and Uncle, only to discover them dead by the hands of the Empire.

When Luke returns to Kenobi, he pledges to go with him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force like his father before him.

## Initiation
### Tests, Allies, and Enemies
The hero learns the rules of the new world and endures tests, meets friends, and comes face-to-face with enemies.

After Luke, Kenobi, and the droids hire Han Solo and Chewbacca to transport them off of Tatooine and onto Alderaan, Kenobi begins Luke’s training in the ways of the Force.

Wielding his father’s lightsaber, Kenobi challenges him to block the shots of a small training remote. At first, he can’t do it. But then Kenobi gives him a helmet to wear that has a blast shield that blocks his view of the remote. Kenobi teaches him to reach out and trust his feelings.

Luke blocks three shots from the remote — blind.

### The Approach/Approach to the Inmost Cave
The initial plan to take on the central conflict begins, but setbacks occur that cause the hero to try a new approach or adopt new ideas.

The plan to defeat the Galactic Empire is to bring the Death Star plans to Alderaan so that Princess Leia’s father can take them to the Rebellion. However, when they arrive within the system, the planet is destroyed. They come across the Death Star and are pulled in by a tractor beam, now trapped within the metaphorical belly of the beast — The Galactic Empire.

### The Ordeal
Things go wrong and added conflict is introduced. The hero experiences more difficult hurdles and obstacles, some of which may lead to a life crisis.

As Kenobi goes off to deactivate the tractor beam so they can escape, Luke, Han, and Chewbacca discover that Princess Leia is being held on the Death Star with them. They rescue her and escape to the Millennium Falcon, hoping that Kenobi has successfully deactivated the tractor beam.

Kenobi later sacrifices himself as Luke watches Darth Vader strike him down. Luke must now avenge his fallen mentor and carry on his teachings.

### Reward
After surviving The Ordeal, the hero seizes _**the sword**_ — a reward that they’ve earned that allows them to take on the biggest conflict. It may be a physical item or piece of knowledge or wisdom that will help them persevere.

Luke has saved the princess and retrieved the Death Star plans. They now have the knowledge to destroy the Galactic Empire’s greatest weapon once and for all.

## Return
### The Road Back
The hero sees the light at the end of the tunnel, but they are about to face even more tests and challenges.

Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and the droids are headed to the hidden Rebellion base with the Death Star plans. They are suddenly pursued by incoming TIE-Fighters, forcing Han and Luke to take action to defend the ship and escape with their lives — and the plans.

When they are triumphant, they realize that the Galactic Empire must be tracking them. But they have no choice but to race against time to take the plans to the Rebellion and prepare for battle.

### The Resurrection
The climax. The hero faces a final test, using everything they have learned to take on the conflict once and for all.

The Rebels — along with Luke as an X-Wing pilot — prepare to take on the Death Star.

The Rebellion and the Galactic Empire wage war in an epic space battle. Luke is the only X-Wing pilot that was able to get within the trenches of the Death Star. But Darth Vader and his wingmen are in hot pursuit. Just as Darth Vader is about to destroy Luke, Han returns and clears the way for Luke.

Luke uses the Force to guide his aiming as he fires upon the sole weak point of the deadly Death Star, destroying it for good.

### The Return/Return with the Elixir
The hero brings their knowledge or the “elixir” back to the ordinary world.

Luke and Han return to the Rebellion base, triumphant, as they receive medals for the heroic journey. There is peace throughout the galaxy — at least for now.
