## [[1.1 The Call to Adventure]]
### EXT. [[Genton|GENTON]]

**[[Luke Campbell|LUKE]]:** Hey, there's some weird shit going down in town, and now [[Sam Ward|my best friend]] is missing. What can I do?

**STRANGER:** You didn't hear it from me, but there's this weird old guy up in the mountains who might know a thing or two. You should talk to him. Ask him about... (sotto) [[CURSED AL]].

**LUKE:** Got it, thanks!

**LUKE:** I don't have a car... Guess I'll just borrow [[Luke's Noble Steed|Pauline]]. Hope [[Ma & Pa Campbell|my parents]] don't mind...

\[...\]

### EXT. [[The Old Silver Mine|PLATA MINING MUSEUM]]

**LUKE:** Hi, are you the weird old guy who knows magic?

**[[James RedawiÄ‡|JAMES]]:** No.

**LUKE:** Are you sure?

**JAMES:** ...Yes.

**LUKE:** Okay. Guess I'll just keep looking for someone who knows anything about... (sotto) CURSED AL.

**JAMES (pulling Luke aside):** What did you say?! Where did you hear that name?

**LUKE:** I dunno, some guy told me about it when I was complaining about my town having really bad vibes lately.

**JAMES:** Tell. Me. Everything.

\[...\]

## [[1.2 Refusal of the Call]]
### INT. JAMES'S HOUSE

**JAMES:** My gods... So it's true. CURSED AL has returned.

**JAMES:** Looking at you now, it's apparent that you're THE CHOSEN ONE. I don't know how I didn't see it before.

**LUKE:** The chosen one?

**JAMES:** No, no, not "the chosen one". "THE CHOSEN ONE." It's in all caps.

**LUKE:** Oh, okay.

**LUKE:** Wait, what? What do you mean I'm the chosen one in all caps?

**JAMES (pinching the bridge of his nose):** It means you're the only one whose [[SOUL]] could possibly wield [[Magic|magic]] strong enough to defeat CURSED AL.

**LUKE:** Me? Magic? In my SOUL? Me? Are you sure?

**JAMES:** Unfortunately, yes. There is no doubt in my mind that you are THE CHOSEN ONE, no matter how much I wish otherwise.

**LUKE:** How much *you* wish? What about me? That sounds scary! I don't think I want to do that.

**LUKE:** I'm going back home. I bet Sam was probably just using the bathroom or something.

### INT. A CAVE NEARBY

**[[The Dragon|EDNA]]:** My, my... I sense something incredibly beautiful nearby...

\[Looking out of her lair, she spots Pauline.\]

**EDNA:** By the gods, that is the most divine creature I have ever laid eyes on. I am smitten.

\[She approaches the mare coyly, or at least as coyly as an enormous dragon can. She attempts to give it a wolf-whistle.\]

**PAULINE (in horse):** Holy shit! Is that a fucking dragon?! What the fuck?!

**EDNA:** Hi gongeous

**PAULINE (still in horse):** I didn't sign up for this shit! Get me out of here!

\[The horse runs away in a panic. It loses its footing and falls off a cliff.]

**EDNA:** Alas.

### EXT. [[Plata|PLATA]]

**LUKE:** No, sir, you're not making me do magic. That's the devil's work, alright.

**LUKE:** Now, where's my horse?

\[Distant sounds of whinnying and draconic sobbing\]

**LUKE:** Pauline? Is that you, girl? Are you alright?

\[He sets off on foot to search for her.]

**JAMES:** Wait! It's no use, boy! You're too late. The dragon has surely eaten her by now.

**LUKE:** 
![[The_What .jpg]]

**JAMES:** Ednathrallor, Tyrant of the Mountains. She eats horses and their riders whole.

**LUKE (distraught):** So what am I supposed to do now? That was my mom's favorite horse! And also my only ride. How am I supposed to get back to Genton?

**JAMES:** Guess you'll have no choice but to undergo your CHOSEN ONE training, then.

**LUKE:** ...Fine.

## [[1.3 Supernatural Aid]]
### EXT. OUTSIDE OF PLATA
**JAMES:** Okay, here's a sword. If that doesn't work, I also have this gun.

**LUKE:** A gun isn't magic!

**JAMES:** It casts the spell "Long-Distance Lead Poisoning" and deals 2d6 piercing damage.

**LUKE:** Wow! Magic is everywhere!

**JAMES:** Anyway, your first trial is to go to ~~Detroit~~ [[Rhapsody]] and bring me a ~~shrubbery~~ [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|legendary artifact]].

**LUKE:** ~~Detroit~~ Rhapsody?! Wait, aren't you going to give me any training first?

**LUKE:** And what does this "legendary artifact" even look like?

**JAMES:** Nah, you'll be fine. Just use the force. The deadly force. That I'm giving you. The gun.

**LUKE:** And the artifact?

**JAMES**: You'll know it when you see it. Now get out of here! You want to save your friend, don't you?

**LUKE:** Okay...

\[Luke sets off. James pulls out a phone and dials someone.\]

**JAMES:** Eddie, baby, how are ya? What'd you think of that horse I set you up with?

**JAMES:** It what? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

**JAMES:** Eddie. Edna. I mean this in the nicest possible way, but maybe horses just aren't for you. Why don't you try finding another dragon?

**JAMES:** Geez, okay, sorry I mentioned it. I'll give you some space. Take care of yourself, Eddie!
