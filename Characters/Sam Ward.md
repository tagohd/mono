## Sam, THE INNOCENT ONE
Love interest for [Luke](Luke%20Campbell.md).

(Note 2023-05-21: I really haven’t written much about Sam. All that’s been decided so far is that they’re nonbinary, and their [[SOUL]] has been taken by [[CURSED AL]].)

How old are they? What do they look like? What's their personality? Why does Luke like them? Why did CURSED AL take their SOUL?

>Perhaps it will be a recurring theme that Luke will find something that reminds him of Sam.

What are some things that would remind Luke of Sam? And are they directly connected to Sam (i.e. something they actually owned), or is it just like, "These are Sam's favorite flowers"? Maybe Sam is also very fond of [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|chocolate oranges]].
