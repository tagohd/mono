# Sam, THE INNOCENT ONE
Love interest for [Luke](Luke%20Campbell.md).

(Note 2023-05-21: I really haven’t written much about Sam. All that’s been decided so far is that they’re nonbinary, and their [[SOUL]] has been taken by [[CURSED AL]].)

[question:: What's their personality? Why does Luke like them?]

Why did CURSED AL take their SOUL? Maybe they don't actually have a SOUL, and that's why they're important to CURSED AL's plan. (See: [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]]) So, he didn't just take their SOUL, he straight up kidnapped them.

[[4 - The Crossing of the First Threshold]]
>Perhaps it will be a recurring theme that Luke will find something that reminds him of Sam.

[question:: What are some things that would remind Luke of Sam?] And are they directly connected to Sam (i.e. something they actually owned), or is it just like, "These are Sam's favorite flowers"? Maybe Sam is also very fond of [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|chocolate oranges]]?

# Characterizations

* They're about Luke's age, so... 16-17? (I haven't really decided how old Luke is, either.)
* They're taller than [[Luke Campbell|Luke]]. In addition to being kind and dumb, Luke is also smol, so most people are taller than him, actually.
* Sam is based on a red fox (*Vulpes vulpes*), to the extent that that fits in the confines of the [[(5) May 2023 Chat Logs#Furites paradox|Furites paradox]]
* Do they *really* need saving from CURSED AL? Maybe they're more capable than Luke thinks.
* Or maybe (dun DUN DUNNN), getting captured was their plan all along!!! (Big maybe)
* On the cross-country team with Luke, except they actually enjoy it
* Their lack of SOUL makes them a crucial component of CURSED AL's plan

>[!question] Is Sam short for "Samuel" or "Samantha"?
>Neither. It's short for "Sammich". (You'll never find out their AGAB or their deadname.)
>
>Actually, maybe they don't even have a deadname. Sammich is their actual birth name.
