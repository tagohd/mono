# James, THE DARK MAGICIAN
Former lover of [[CURSED AL]], now seeking revenge after believing AL to have abandoned him for 20+ years (and also paralyzing him in the process).

## James, THE MUSEUM OWNER?
Mysterious and reclusive. Lives in [[Plata]]. Runs a [[The Old Silver Mine|museum]] converted from an abandoned silver mine. Reluctantly trains [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] in the use of [[Magic]].

He's not necessarily rude, but he tends to be laconic, and he doesn't volunteer much information... Unless you're asking him about the mine. He seems to have a different persona he adopts when he's working at the museum. It's not just a job to him; he is, in fact, very passionate about the history of the mine.

## The Enemy of My Enemy Is Not My Friend
He's manipulating Luke into defeating CURSED AL. I mean, you don't date a guy like CURSED AL if you're not at least a little evil yourself. (It wasn't an abusive relationship or anything, btw. They were just both evil.)

>[!question] [aq:: When/how did James become paralyzed?]
>How: I think it would be "good" if it's AL's fault somehow.

>When: If it happened when AL tried to cast [[Longevity (Spell)|Longevity]], then he's been paralyzed for a long time, and that kinda breaks the idea I had in [[1. Plot Overview]] that he's scamming [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] for money to make his house wheelchair-accessible. He could still be scamming them just because he's an evil bastard, I guess. I think having him be paralyzed when AL disappeared gives him extra motivation to hate AL, though.
