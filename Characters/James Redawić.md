# James, THE DARK MAGICIAN
Perhaps he meddled with something he shouldn’t have and released [[CURSED AL]] from his prison. Former lover of Al?

## James, THE MUSEUM OWNER?
Mysterious and reclusive. Lives in [[Plata]]. Runs a [[The Old Silver Mine|museum]] converted from an abandoned silver mine. Reluctantly trains [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] in the use of [[Magic]].

He's not necessarily rude, but he tends to be laconic, and he doesn't volunteer much information... Unless you're asking him about the mine. He seems to have a different persona he adopts when he's working at the museum. It's not just a job to him; he is, in fact, very passionate about the history of the mine.

He's manipulating Luke into defeating CURSED AL. I mean, you don't date a guy like CURSED AL if you're not at least a little evil yourself. (It wasn't an abusive relationship or anything, btw. They were just both evil.)

[Lun]: Oh, that explains the "James is kind of a bitch" thing

Or maybe CURSED AL is manipulating James into manipulating Luke? James knows where [[The Legendary Artifacts]] are because AL told him. James gives this information to Luke so that he can stop AL from making the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] (James does not want to live forever, especially if it means the destruction of the universe), but this does mean that Luke ends up making AL's job easier.

[Lun]: Having someone collect all parts of some cursed machine to stop someone else from collecting them seems to indeed be quite the idiot move. Is James also dumb?  Or did Luke just misinterpret whatever James said and was then unable to get corrected after James fucking Died™
[Sudo]: This might be a case of "The author is also an idiot." Maybe the plan *was* for the artifacts to be destroyed, but James was like, "You're still a novice. You won't be able to handle the mana needed to cast Destroy Legendary Artifact, so just bring them back to me, and I'll take care of that." But then, because they're cursed artifacts, James becomes unwilling to destroy them.
[Sudo]: "Oh, pwease don't destwoy us, Mr. Wizard! Think about all the weally cool spells you could cast with us!"
[Sudo]: And James is like, "Hmmm, that's a good point."
