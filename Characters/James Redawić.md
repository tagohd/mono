# James, THE DARK MAGICIAN
Perhaps he meddled with something he shouldnâ€™t have and released [[CURSED AL]] from his prison. Former lover of Al?

## James, THE MUSEUM OWNER?
Mysterious and reclusive. Lives in [[Plata]]. Runs a [[The Old Silver Mine|museum]] converted from an abandoned silver mine. Reluctantly trains [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] in the use of [[Magic]].

He's not necessarily rude, but he tends to be laconic, and he doesn't volunteer much information...

- [ ] Unless you're asking him about the mine. He seems to have a different persona he adopts when he's working at the museum. It's not just a job to him; he is, in fact, very passionate about the history of the mine. -OR-
- [ ] Even if you're asking about the mine. Although he's very knowledgeable, he's learned that people tend to get wary when he speaks as though he were really there 150 years ago. He curates the museum, but his partner, [[Bering Strait Grigori|Grigori]], is the museum's "face".
