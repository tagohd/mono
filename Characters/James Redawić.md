# James, THE DARK MAGICIAN
Perhaps he meddled with something he shouldnâ€™t have and released [[CURSED AL]] from his prison. Former lover of Al?

## James, THE MUSEUM OWNER?
Mysterious and reclusive. Lives in [[Plata]]. Runs a [[The Old Silver Mine|museum]] converted from an abandoned silver mine. Reluctantly trains [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] in the use of [[Magic]].

He's not necessarily rude, but he tends to be laconic, and he doesn't volunteer much information... Unless you're asking him about the mine. He seems to have a different persona he adopts when he's working at the museum. It's not just a job to him; he is, in fact, very passionate about the history of the mine.

## The Enemy of My Enemy Is Not My Friend

He's manipulating Luke into defeating CURSED AL. I mean, you don't date a guy like CURSED AL if you're not at least a little evil yourself. (It wasn't an abusive relationship or anything, btw. They were just both evil.)

Or maybe CURSED AL is manipulating James into manipulating Luke? James knows where [[The Legendary Artifacts]] because AL told him. James gives this information to Luke so that he can stop AL from making the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] (James does not want to live forever, especially if it means the destruction of the universe), but this does mean that Luke ends up making AL's job easier.
