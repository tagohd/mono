You thought [[CURSED AL]] was [The Big Bad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad)? Think again. The Emperoress is the master of nonbinary slay. (Goddamn, I am spending too much time on Tumblr.) Often mistakenly believed to be two separate people, but really just one genderfluid badass. Maybe they're modeled after Commander James Stephanie Sterling (pictured below). (Please note that the real Commander Sterling uses they/them pronouns.)

- The one actually pulling all the strings
- The bigender/genderfluid master of CURSED AL
	- Many believe they're two separate people
- Possibly the same as [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder]]?

>No.
