Actually just one of [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|Edna's]] garden gnomes. He was an outlier adn should not have been counted.

What if he's [[Sam Ward|Sam's]] father? He jumped in front of Sam to protect them from [[CURSED AL]] and got turned into a gnome. Then AL brought him to Edna because he knows how much she loves gnomes. (See: [[(Talk) BFS 10000#^c9847f]])

> L: Hold on, when did this happen? When AL abducted Sam?
