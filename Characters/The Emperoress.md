You thought [[CURSED AL]] was [The Big Bad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad)? Think again. The Emperoress is the master of nonbinary slay. (Goddamn, I am spending too much time on Tumblr.) Often mistakenly believed to be two separate people, but really just one genderfluid badass. Maybe they're modeled after Commander James Stephanie Sterling (pictured below).
