Another person trying to obtain [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]] in the city of [[Rhapsody]]. [[Luke Campbell#^cd5bb3|Luke]] saves him from something, and he concedes defeat, allowing Luke to possess THE ORB. He tries to keep Luke safe from THE ORB's corrupting influence, but it's not because he likes him or anything, b-baka.

Maybe instead of meeting Luke in Rhapsody, he works at [[The Old Silver Mine]] for [[James Redawić|James]], or is otherwise another apprentice of James.

>This could also set up something of a “No, I am your father” moment when Luke first confronts AL. AL just wipes the floor with Luke (maybe it’s one of those scripted battles where you’re supposed to lose), and Luke says something like, “How could I have lost? I thought I was THE CHOSEN ONE.” And AL’s just like

### Response
I was thinking it was more like: you lose this first time, and then you come back later after you've gained more power-ups or something and then you can defeat him. I'm sure this happens in several video games, but the first example that comes to mind for me is Mega Man X. The very first stage ends with a fight against Vile that you can't win. X isn't strong enough, and Zero has to save him. (Spoilers for a 29-year-old game ahead)

After X has defeated all of the Mavericks and is preparing to take on Sigma, he has to fight Vile again. He loses. Again. Zero saves him. Again. Except this time Zero sacrifices himself, which completely refills X's health bar (somehow), and then you fight Vile for real and defeat him. And then, with his dying "breath" (he's a robot), Zero gives X some motivational "I always knew you could do it, go on without me" kind of speech.

Hmmm, maybe [[Case Weston|Case]] could have a similar arc...

Okay, so I watched [the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4NQsVWsf08) again. (Watch how the guy recording this throws the first half; it's not like the OMORI fight where you actually have to try before the scripted defeat happens.) First, it's not explained at all how X heals. He just does it. Even Vile is confused. Second, Zero's dying words aren't nearly as motivating as I remembered:

>X, I've taken too much damage......
>Auto repair systems can't handle it...
>My power is fading fast...
>Your power is greater than I thought.
>Maybe you can destroy Sigma.
