Another person trying to obtain [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]] in the city of [[Rhapsody]]. [[Luke Campbell#^cd5bb3|Luke]] saves him from something, and he concedes defeat, allowing Luke to possess THE ORB. He tries to keep Luke safe from THE ORB's corrupting influence, but it's not because he likes him or anything, b-baka.

Maybe instead of meeting Luke in Rhapsody, he works at [[The Old Silver Mine]] for [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]], or is otherwise another apprentice of James.
