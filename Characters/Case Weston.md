alias: Case
---
Another person trying to obtain [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]] in the city of [[Rhapsody]]. [[Luke Campbell#^cd5bb3|Luke]] saves him from something, and he concedes defeat, allowing Luke to possess THE ORB. He tries to keep Luke safe from THE ORB's corrupting influence, but it's not because he likes him or anything, b-baka.

Maybe instead of meeting Luke in Rhapsody, he works at [[The Old Silver Mine]] for [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]], or is otherwise another apprentice of James.

# The Things He Does For Love
Maybe [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] fights [[CURSED AL]] for the first time and is woefully unprepared, and Case steps in to help Luke out. Then when Luke fights AL for the last time, Case ends up sacrificing himself. (Cf: [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs]] and [[Repo organization]]) #Cite/Game/Mega-Man-X [gameRefType:: MMX/Plot]
