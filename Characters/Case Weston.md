Sudosays:: Huh. The main character's name is Luke. And the secondary protagonist(?) is named Case? Luke and Case. Wonder where I came up with that. Luke and Case. Lucas. And ~~Clase~~ Claus?
Sudosays:: Also, Case Weston sounds a little too similar to Case Western, as in Case Western Reserve University.

Another person trying to obtain [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]] in the city of [[Rhapsody]]. [[Luke Campbell#^cd5bb3|Luke]] saves him from something, and he concedes defeat, allowing Luke to possess THE ORB. He tries to keep Luke safe from THE ORB's corrupting influence, but it's not because he likes him or anything, b-baka.

Wolfwood == Case, Vash == Luke #Cite/TV/Trigun98 [tvRefType:: Trigun/Character]

Maybe instead of meeting Luke in Rhapsody, he works at [[The Old Silver Mine]] for [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]], or is otherwise another apprentice of James.

# The Things He Does For Love
Maybe [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] fights [[CURSED AL]] for the first time and is woefully unprepared, and Case steps in to help Luke out. Then when Luke fights AL for the last time, Case ends up sacrificing himself. (Cf: [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs]] and [[Repo organization]]) #Cite/Game/Mega-Man-X [gameRefType:: MMX/Plot]

[Lun]: MY LOVE INTEREST!!! At least let Luke revive him after defeating AL. Oh, or what if you get to use the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] after defeating AL for a purpose of the player's choice? You could revive a love interest that died, revive James, AL(??!?), or use it for something different entirely.

[Sudo]: Oooh, that's a really good idea! You know, except for the part where it might destroy the universe.
[Sudo]: Lol, multiple endings, but most of them are just "The universe was destroyed, but you get to spend eternity with $Character"
[Sudo]: Hmmm, I had another gameplay idea earlier, but what was it?
[Sudo]: Oh, it was: after you discover that Luke is [[LukeVISION (TM)|colorblind]], the game display changes to reflect that.
[Sudo]: Funny coming up with these ideas when the game is not being made.
