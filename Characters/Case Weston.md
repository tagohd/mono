Sudosays:: Huh. The main character's name is Luke. And the secondary protagonist(?) is named Case? Luke and Case. Wonder where I came up with that. Luke and Case. Lucas. And ~~Clase~~ Claus?
Sudosays:: Also, Case Weston sounds a little too similar to Case Western, as in Case Western Reserve University. Well, Donald Knuth (inventor of TeX, among other accomplishments) and Gregg Gillis (Girl Talk) went there, so maybe it can stay.

Another person trying to obtain [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]] in the city of [[Rhapsody]]. [[Luke Campbell#^cd5bb3|Luke]] saves him from something, and he concedes defeat, allowing Luke to possess THE ORB. He tries to keep Luke safe from THE ORB's corrupting influence, but it's not because he likes him or anything, b-baka.

Wolfwood == Case, Vash == Luke #Cite/TV/Trigun98 [tvRefType:: Trigun/Character]

Not just in personality/appearance. He also has a big fuck-off gun shaped like a cross.

Maybe instead of meeting Luke in Rhapsody, he works at [[The Old Silver Mine]] for [[James Redawić|James]], or is otherwise another apprentice of James.

OOOH! Maybe he's an [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] auditor sent to investigate James (so, he's not just Wolfwood; he's also Milly[^1]). IMAS caught wind that James is researching the spell [[Destroy Legendary Artifact]], and being a group of huge nerds, they aren't too happy about the possibility of priceless [[Legendary Artifacts]] being destroyed. Unlike Meryl and Milly, he's undercover.

[Lun]: Oh, this doesn't work anymore with my whole idea for [[James's Excuse]], but that hasn't been agreed upon anyway. Also, he might be investigating James for the IMAS for other reasons if we go that route (he's a powerful evil wizard man who seems to be getting increasingly unstable or something).

%%
sudoMajor: Yeah, that could work. Oh, maybe James is defrauding IMAS out of a lot of grant money or something.

This was in [[1. Plot Overview]], so I'm marking it as read.
%%

[^1]: Personality-wise, he's probably more similar to Meryl, but Milly also has a big fuck-off gun, and that's an important part of Case's character.

>[!question] Undercover as what?
>Maybe he works at the museum after all. He hasn't been able to find out much about James's plan, but he has learned a lot about turn-of-the-century mining techniques. (See: [[James Redawić#James, THE MUSEUM OWNER?]])

# The Things He Does For Love
Maybe [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] fights [[CURSED AL]] for the first time and is woefully unprepared, and Case steps in to help Luke out. Then when Luke fights AL for the last time, Case ends up sacrificing himself. (Cf: [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs]] and [[Repo organization]]) #Cite/Game/Mega-Man-X [gameRefType:: MMX/Plot]

[Lun]: MY LOVE INTEREST!!! At least let Luke revive him after defeating AL. Oh, or what if you get to use the [[BFS 10000]] after defeating AL for a purpose of the player's choice? You could revive a love interest that died, revive James, AL(??!?), or use it for something different entirely.

[Sudo]: Oooh, that's a really good idea! You know, except for the part where it might destroy the universe.
[Sudo]: Lol, multiple endings, but most of them are just "The universe was destroyed, but you get to spend eternity with $Character"
[Sudo]: Hmmm, I had another gameplay idea earlier, but what was it?
[Sudo]: Oh, it was: after you discover that Luke is [[LukeVISION (TM)|colorblind]], the game display changes to reflect that.
[Sudo]: Funny coming up with these ideas when the game is not being made.

# Old Notes
- He shows up near the end of Act I, first as an antagonist and later as a love interest?
	- Maybe it's one-sided. However, Luke *does* have two hands...
- Nicholas D. Wolfwood. He's Nicholas D. Wolfwood. #Cite/TV/Trigun98 [tvRefType:: Trigun/Character]
	- He's not a wolf, though. That would be too obvious.
- Probably just a bit older than Luke, maybe 19

aq:: What species is Case?
He's a wolverine.
