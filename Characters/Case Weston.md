# About
![[case_weston.jpg]]
Wolfwood == Case, Vash == Luke #Cite/TV/Trigun98 [tvRefType:: Trigun/Character]

Not just in personality/appearance. He also has a big fuck-off gun shaped like a cross.

He works at [[The Old Silver Mine]] for [[James Redawić|James]]. He's actually an (apprentice) [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] auditor sent to investigate James (so, he's not just Wolfwood; he's also Milly[^1]). Unlike Meryl and Milly, he's undercover.

[^1]: Personality-wise, he's probably more similar to Meryl, but Milly also has a big fuck-off gun, and that's an important part of Case's character.

>[!question] Undercover as what?
>Maybe he works at the museum after all. He hasn't been able to find out much about James's plan, but he has learned a lot about turn-of-the-century mining techniques. (See: [[James Redawić#James, THE MUSEUM OWNER?]])

# The Things He Does For Love
Maybe [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] fights [[CURSED AL]] for the first time and is woefully unprepared, and Case steps in to help Luke out. Then when Luke fights AL for the last time, Case ends up sacrificing himself. (Cf: [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs]] and [[Repo organization]]) #Cite/Game/Mega-Man-X [gameRefType:: MMX/Plot]

# Characterizations
**Case**
- Kinda jealous that Luke is THE CHOSEN ONE?
- He looks serious, but he can make silly jokes, too, sometimes (especially around Luke?)
- I've said that he's tsundere, but I feel like I haven't really written him that way? At the very least, it's apparent from his actions (if not his words) that he genuinely cares for Luke (saves his ass at least twice, and looks like a badass while doing it; promises Luke that he'll protect him; reassures Luke that he isn't dead (yet))
	- This is because he, too, is a Good Boy (TM) (though he may be more reluctant to admit it than Luke)
	- Is he only nice to Luke because he thinks Luke is THE CHOSEN ONE? (Maybe at first?)
	- Does seem to be (initially) confused by finding Luke attractive, at least
- ![[megamind_no_parents.jpg]]
- Is the smart one
- If he's Wolfwood, then he's probably not quite as concerned with the morality of killing people as Luke is
- Australian?
- Rides a motorcycle
	- \[image pending\]
- ~~Professional MILF hunter (may or may not be literally hunting them for sport lol)~~
	- ![[milf hunter case.png]]

## Questions
- What is the character's go-to drink order? (How do they like to be publicly perceived?)
- What is their grooming routine? (How do they treat themselves in private?)
- What was their most expensive purchase/where does their disposable income go?
	- Probably his motorcycle
- Do they have any scars or tattoos?
	- Tattoos? Idk, maybe he's the kind of guy to have a full back tattoo? Probably not.
	- Top surgery scars
	- Probably a few others from fights in school or abuse
- When was the last time they cried, and under what circumstances?
	- It's probably been a while. I don't think he cries very often. He might want to, but he holds back. He wants to look tough.
- Are they an oldest, middle, youngest, or only child?
	- If he's not actually an older brother, he at least sees himself that way with Luke.
- Describe the shoes they're wearing.
- Describe the place where they sleep. (What does their safe space look like?)
- What is their (least) favorite holiday? (How do they relate to their culture/outside world?)
- What objects do they always carry around with them? (What do they need for their normal, day-to-day routine? What does "normal" even look like for them?)
