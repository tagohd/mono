# About
![[case_weston.jpg]]
Wolfwood == Case, Vash == Luke #Cite/TV/Trigun98 [tvRefType:: Trigun/Character]

Not just in personality/appearance. He also has a big fuck-off gun shaped like a cross.

He works at [[The Old Silver Mine]] for [[James Redawić|James]]. He's actually an (apprentice) [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] auditor sent to investigate James (so, he's not just Wolfwood; he's also Milly[^1]). Unlike Meryl and Milly, he's undercover.

[^1]: Personality-wise, he's probably more similar to Meryl, but Milly also has a big fuck-off gun, and that's an important part of Case's character.

>[!question] Undercover as what?
>Maybe he works at the museum after all. He hasn't been able to find out much about James's plan, but he has learned a lot about turn-of-the-century mining techniques. (See: [[James Redawić#James, THE MUSEUM OWNER?]])

# The Things He Does For Love
Maybe [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] fights [[CURSED AL]] for the first time and is woefully unprepared, and Case steps in to help Luke out. Then when Luke fights AL for the last time, Case ends up sacrificing himself. (Cf: [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs]] and [[Repo organization]]) #Cite/Game/Mega-Man-X [gameRefType:: MMX/Plot]
