# General Notes
- Every character is queer (except for [[All Characters#Boring Straight Greg|Boring Straight Greg]]) and some sort of furry

# Main
## [[Luke Campbell]]
#Cite/Movie/Star-Wars (for the name)
- Protagonist
- Dogboy
- 16-ish?
- Imagine if Vash the Stampede were a short king. And a dogboy. #Cite/TV/Trigun98 
	- Goofy blond guy that doesn't look like he could easily fuck you up, but he can. He just chooses not to.
	- Tragic backstory?
	- Also has a tendency to be put into Situations (TM)

## [[CURSED AL]]
- Main Antagonist
- Unspeakably old (or maybe he's James's age?)
- Species: spoopy (a raven, maybe?)
- Has antlers though #Cite/TV/The-Owl-House

## [[James Redawić]]
- Mentor to Luke
- Looks like he's in his 30s, but he's actually closer to 200 years old
- Runs a [[The Old Silver Mine|museum]] out of the abandoned silver mine in [[Plata]]
- Also some kind of bird-person

## [[Sam Ward]]
- "Damsel in distress", but they're not a damsel, and whether they're in distress is also debatable
	- It'd be funny if they actually were in distress, but they're like, absolutely shredded.
	- They're already an absolute U N I T, but then you put them next to Luke, who is a smol bean, and they look even more massive
	- Like, you look at them next to CURSED AL, and it's clear they could easily just snap him in half, but they're completely unaware of this
		- I'm going to say that, depending on how many [[SOUL|souls]] CURSED AL currently possesses, a light breeze could knock him over
		- #Cite/Unknown
- Luke's neighbor/best friend/love interest
- Red fox
- Close in age to Luke

# Supporting
## [[Case Weston]]
- He shows up near the end of Act I, first as an antagonist and later as a love interest?
	- Maybe it's one-sided. However, Luke *does* have two hands...
- Nicholas D. Wolfwood. He's Nicholas D. Wolfwood. #Cite/TV/Trigun98 
	- He's not a wolf, though. That would be too obvious.

## [[The Emperoress]]
- The one actually pulling all the strings
- The bigender/genderfluid master of CURSED AL
	- Many believe they're two separate people
- Possibly the same as [[The Dragon]]?

## [[The Dragon]]
- You'd think this is the true main antagonist, but she's actually [[(12) December 2020 Chat Logs#^8a0296|super chill]]
- Tragically in love with Pauline, the horse #Cite/Movie/Shrek

## [[Luke's Noble Steed|Pauline]]
- Luke's noble steed
- A bay mare
- Just an ordinary horse

## [[Ma & Pa Campbell]]
- Luke's loving parents

# Other?
## [[Boring Straight Greg]]
- Diversity hire, not to be confused with the significantly cooler [[Bering Strait Grigori]]

## [[Bering Strait Grigori]]
- Helps James run the [[Plata]] Mine Museum
- He's a bear, in *both* senses of the word

## [[Steve the Royalty-Free Skeleton]]
- just a normal skeleton. nothing to see here. #Cite/Game/Undertale
