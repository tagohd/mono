alias: horse, Pauline
---

A bay mare named Pauline. A good, reliable horse, but just a normal horse nonetheless.

>[!question] Is she [[Luke Campbell|Luke's]] horse, or is he merely "borrowing" her?
>Technically, she belongs to [[Ma & Pa Campbell|his parents]], but she's effectively Luke's horse. His parents may have their own horse(s). (Luke's parents must be pretty rich then.)

[[The Dragon|Edna]] is in love with her, but she can't reciprocate because she's a horse.
