alias: horse, Pauline
---

A bay mare named Pauline. A good, reliable horse, but just a normal horse nonetheless. Does she belong to [[Luke Campbell|Luke]], or is he merely "borrowing" her? Maybe she belongs to [[Ma & Pa Campbell|his parents]]?

[[The Dragon|Edna]] is in love with her, but she can't reciprocate because she's a horse.
