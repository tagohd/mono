%%question:: Why doesn't James just get the Artifacts himself?%%
![[uhhh.jpg]]

>[!info] What if he's paraplegic?

>[!question] Okay, then why doesn't he just... magic himself up a cure?
>[[Magic]] doesn't work that way?

>[!question] Why not? Why is anyone disabled in a universe where magic exists?
>Just because (almost) anyone can use magic doesn't mean everyone *should*. Magic is dangerous. You're literally tearing holes into the fabric of reality, and if you're not careful, that can have some pretty dire consequences.

>[!note] Maybe [[Sam Ward|Sam]] can't use magic because they don't have a [[SOUL]]

>[!question] So then, wouldn't there be a class of mages who specialize in healing magic? Like doctors?
>Maybe they're really expensive. Like doctors. You think James can afford that with the money he makes from the museum?

>[!question] But James is a powerful mage himself! Why can't he just heal himself? (Or cast Infinite Money?)
>Maybe that's how he became paralyzed in the first place?

>[!info] Maybe he isn't really paralyzed. Maybe it's an *illusion*
>And [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] naively falls for it
