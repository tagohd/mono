# Why doesn't James just get the Artifacts himself?

![[uhhh.jpg]]

>[!idea] What if he's paraplegic?

>[!question] Okay, then why doesn't he just... magic himself up a cure?
>[[Magic]] doesn't work that way?

>[!question] Why not? Why is anyone disabled in a universe where magic exists?
>Just because (almost) anyone can use magic doesn't mean everyone *should*. Magic is dangerous. You're literally tearing holes into the fabric of reality, and if you're not careful, that can have some pretty dire consequences.
>>[!note] Maybe [[Sam Ward|Sam]] can't use magic because they don't have a [[SOUL]]

>[!question] So then, wouldn't there be a class of mages who specialize in healing magic? Like doctors?
>Maybe they're really expensive. Like doctors. You think [[James Redawić|James]] can afford that with the money he makes from the [[The Old Silver Mine|museum]]? (Oh, sorry, maybe that doesn't make sense if you live in a civilized country.)

>[!question] But James is a powerful mage himself! Why can't he just heal himself? (Or cast Infinite Money?)
>Maybe that's how he became paralyzed in the first place?

>[!idea] Maybe he isn't really paralyzed. Maybe it's an *illusion*
>And [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] naively falls for it

>[!idea] And maybe James is actually working in cahoots with [[CURSED AL]]
>Or he wants to make it seem that way (to AL, not to Luke), and he'll use [[The Legendary Artifacts]] himself and betray AL

>[!question] Okay, so then why can't AL get the artifacts himself?
>Who said he can't? Maybe it *is* like Mother 3, and sometimes AL (or one of his underlings) gets to the artifact first. But, unlike Mother 3, you can't build the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] with just a simple majority of the artifacts. You need all of them. %%#Cite/Game/Mother3 gameRefType:: Mother3/Plot%%


>[!question] Also, why would James want to use the Artifacts himself? I thought he *didn't* want to destroy the universe.
>Okay, maybe this was a bad idea. Or maybe he doesn't want to build the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]]; he wants to do something else with the Artifacts.

>[!idea] Can't we just say Luke is an idiot, so it never occurs to him to question this?
>James really sells him on the whole CHOSEN ONE thing. "It is your destiny to do these errands for me, CHOSEN ONE."
>>[!note] If AL sounds like Chuck McGill, James sounds like Obi-Wan Kenobi

>[!question] He's going to question it eventually. Like when he finds out James has been lying to him.
>Yeah...

>[!idea] Okay, maybe it's not an illusion that James is paraplegic. He's just really, really old.
>Like, 150+ years old. The illusion is that he looks younger. And, yeah, he's using magic to artificially extend his life, but he's still aging. He's just aging slower. (As stated above, magic can only do so much before you start running into consequences.)
>
>He's 150, but he has the joints of a 60-year-old. A reasonably fit 60-year-old, but still. (And he doesn't look a day over 40!) He's not exactly up for an adventure that's going to involve lots of running and climbing and stuff.
>
>Luke, on the other hand, is 16 and runs cross-country. (And, importantly, is easily manipulated.)

>[!question] He's a wizard! Can't he just, like, fly and teleport and stuff?
>Maybe he (ostensibly) really cares about making sure the younger generation is trained in the use of magic?
>![[wizard that knows fuck all.jpg|300]]


[Lun]: Here's an addition to my "Luke misinterpreted James" thing that might work: James did not intend to gather all the artifacts at all. He just wanted Luke to bring him the one (1) from [[Rhapsody]] to check if it's still there, maybe study it (and get a little addicted to its evil power?). Then James died shortly after, and Luke was like "Guess I have to collect all the rest now to complete my quest!". And then maybe the reason James didn't want to collect that one himself is that it would have warned AL that he's on to his funny business (whereas a random dogboy taking it is just another unlucky thursday).

[Sudo]: Ah, of course. The perfect solution is for James to just fucking die. What were his motivations? You'll never know. Because he's dead. 

[Lun]: Also, relating what you wrote above: consider that magic might not be able to do _everything_. How I see it, [[Mana]] is really just a funky energy source which you can use to do a bunch of different things. However, most of it is pretty elementary (move stuff, ignite stuff, zap stuff, create simple stuff) whereas something like healing is very much not an elementary thing to do. That would require almost complete biological knowledge on what you want to heal + even if you know what to do, the healing itself would be extremely difficult too, like curing paralysis would probably involve stitching neurons back together.

[Sudo]:  Yeah, that's a good way of looking at it too. Basically my first response: Magic doesn't work that way. Oh, here's a thought:

>[!idea] Anyone *can* use magic, but few know it even exists
>Maybe magic was only recently discovered, given that it exists on [[Mana Plane|a separate plane of reality]]. Or perhaps magic users try to keep its existence a secret because of how dangerous it is. You know, the whole "tearing apart the fabric of reality" thing. And it's kind of a last resort because of how dangerous it is. I'll expand on this more under [[Magic]].


>[!idea] Furthermore, magic is kind of a last resort.
>Again, because of how dangerous it can be, even the most skilled users try to limit how often they use it.
>
>Maybe there are some in-game consequences, too. You've played OneShot, right? Maybe if you use magic too much, you can see it start to corrupt reality; weird glitchy things start showing up, and maybe certain areas become inaccessible. (Probably nothing that would soft-lock you unless you're *really* overusing it.) But it starts out subtle—most players might not even notice it—then ramps up the more you use it.

[Sudo]: I was thinking, "Okay, maybe we go with the first idea. James can't do it because he's in a wheelchair." And then I had the image of him, like, getting into a wheelchair van, but I thought, "Wouldn't there be a better, more magical solution?"
