# Why doesn't James just get the Artifacts himself?
![[uhhh.jpg]]

>[!idea] What if he's paraplegic?

>[!question] Okay, then why doesn't he just... magic himself up a cure?
>[[Magic#WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!|Magic]] doesn't work that way?

>[!question] Why not? Why is anyone disabled in a universe where magic exists?
>Just because (almost) anyone can use magic doesn't mean everyone *should*. Magic is dangerous. You're literally tearing holes into the fabric of reality, and if you're not careful, that can have some pretty dire consequences.
>>[!note] Maybe [[Sam Ward|Sam]] can't use magic because they don't have a [[SOUL]]

>[!question] So then, wouldn't there be a class of mages who specialize in healing magic? Like doctors?
>Maybe they're really expensive. Like doctors. You think [[James Redawić|James]] can afford that with the money he makes from the [[The Old Silver Mine|museum]]? (Oh, sorry, maybe that doesn't make sense if you live in a civilized country.)

>[!question] But James is a powerful mage himself! Why can't he just heal himself? (Or cast Infinite Money?)
>Maybe that's how he became paralyzed in the first place?

>[!idea] Maybe he isn't really paralyzed. Maybe it's an *illusion*
>And [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] naively falls for it

>[!idea] And maybe James is actually working in cahoots with [[CURSED AL]]
>Or he wants to make it seem that way (to AL, not to Luke), and he'll use [[Legendary Artifacts]] himself and betray AL

>[!question] Okay, so then why can't AL get the artifacts himself?
>Who said he can't? Maybe it *is* like Mother 3, and sometimes AL (or one of his underlings) gets to the artifact first. But, unlike Mother 3, you can't build the [[BFS 10000]] with just a simple majority of the artifacts. You need all of them.

>[!question] Also, why would James want to use the Artifacts himself? I thought he *didn't* want to destroy the universe.
>Okay, maybe this was a bad idea. Or maybe he doesn't want to build the [[BFS 10000]]; he wants to do something else with the Artifacts.

>[!idea] Can't we just say Luke is an idiot, so it never occurs to him to question this?
>James really sells him on the whole CHOSEN ONE thing. "It is your destiny to do these errands for me, CHOSEN ONE."

>[!question] He's going to question it eventually. Like when he finds out James has been lying to him.
>Yeah...

>[!idea] Okay, maybe it's not an illusion that James is paraplegic. He's just really, really old.
>Like, 150+ years old. The illusion is that he looks younger. And, yeah, he's using magic to artificially extend his life, but he's still aging. He's just aging slower. (As stated above, magic can only do so much before you start running into consequences.)

>He's 150, but he has the joints of a 60-year-old. A reasonably fit 60-year-old, but still. (And he doesn't look a day over 40!) He's not exactly up for an adventure that's going to involve lots of running and climbing and stuff.

>![[wizard that knows fuck all.jpg|300]]
>Or we can just stick with "Magic doesn't work that way." [[Teleport|Teleportation]] just isn't a spell that exists. The best you can do is [[Evasion|teleport short distances]], kinda like a dash ability. [[Plane Shift]] and [[Astral Projection]] are different.

[Lun]: Here's an addition to my "Luke misinterpreted James" thing that might work: James did not intend to gather all the artifacts at all. He just wanted Luke to bring him the one (1) from [[Rhapsody]] to check if it's still there, maybe study it (and get a little addicted to its evil power?). Then James died shortly after, and Luke was like "Guess I have to collect all the rest now to complete my quest!". And then maybe the reason James didn't want to collect that one himself is that it would have warned AL that he's on to his funny business (whereas a random dogboy taking it is just another unlucky thursday).

[Sudo]: Ah, of course. The perfect solution is for James to just fucking die. What were his motivations? You'll never know. Because he's dead. Or maybe that IS his motivation. He knows he's going to die, so he gets Luke to do it.

[Sudo]: I was thinking, "Okay, maybe we go with the first idea. James can't do it because he's in a wheelchair." And then I had the image of him, like, getting into a wheelchair van, but I thought, "Wouldn't there be a better, more magical solution?" But maybe the answer is, "No, magic doesn't actually affect the world that much if most people don't know about it."

## An answer trying to tie everything above together: James is the evil one

So here's the main idea: [[James Redawić|James]] actually wants [[CURSED AL]] to collect all of the [[Legendary Artifacts]] and assemble the [[BFS 10000]]. He is sending [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] on a quest to collect all of them under the pretense that he's trying to stop AL, but actually wants to use it for himself to both save his own life and kill AL. And then maybe do some other messed up shit, because oh no: turns out he's actually even more fucked up than AL.

[Sudo]: Oh! What if James tells Luke that constructing the [[BFS 10000]] is the only way to defeat CURSED AL? I mean, he wouldn't really be lying. Wait, that's basically what you just said, isn't it? Anyway, I've updated [[Destroy Legendary Artifact]] to reflect this.

This of course raises some questions:
- Why does James want to kill AL??? I thought they were former lovers?
	- Ohoho they sure were. This goes further on the idea that AL placed himself into a stasis while trying to figure out a way to save James' life, but accidentally just went into a separate plane without actually altering the passage of time.
	  From James perspective, he just had a heated discussion with AL where he tried to convince AL to stop messing with dangerously powerful magic that probably wouldn't work anyway and just live the rest of their lives together in peace and then AL just fucking. dipped. _forever_. He just goes "I'll show you I can save you!" and disappears without a trace. James first thinks he just needed a break from their discussion and waits it out. But then he doesn't come back by nightfall. He gets a bit nervous but he keeps waiting. And eventually he starts to search for AL, he gets really fucking panicked and does everything he can to find him but he just can't find a trace of him. So he breaks down and is just unbearably sad. But then years take that sorrow and turn it into rage. And then that rage turns into hatred. _AL left him when he needed him most. And for what?_ For years he wastes away in loneliness, thinking about how he could have been enjoying life together with AL instead of having to endure this suffering.
	  Until he finds out about AL actually having found a way to amplify the power of magic to a ludicrous degree. Maybe it's when AL finally gets out of his stasis and excitedly goes to James to tell him about it (who he then finds to, uh-oh, actually have aged for all the decades he's been researching and completely blows up on AL), or he learns about it some other way. In any case, James starts to plan to use its power to kill AL and finally get his revenge.
  - Alright, so he wants the legendary artefacts to be assembled. Still doesn't explain why he's not doing it himself?
	  - Ah, there's where the hate comes in. He _could_ collect them all himself and give them to AL, but then he would essentially be working together with AL and make use of his help. Even as part of some devious plan, he can't stand the thought of having to be friendly towards AL (or pretend to be) at this point. He fucking _hates_ the guy. So he gets someone else to do it for him and makes it look like it's some hero on a quest to defeat AL. Essentially all to not make it feel like he's either helping AL or depending on him.
	    When Luke asks this question, he probably gives some response like "uh I'm too old" or "I'm crippled" which he does try to make out to be the actual reason, but attentive players can notice that his explanation doesn't entirely make sense (foreshadowing, baby!). Luke of course buys it without a second thought.
  - On the same line, why doesn't AL assemble the artefacts himself? Can't he just spam teleport and get them all instantly?
	  - Not part of the original question, but I figured doing his stasis shenanigans actually backfired really hard on him (as doing overly powerful magic does) and CURSED him, which entails that he lost a lot of power and now looks all spooky. Maybe it also crippled his physical capabilities?
  - What about the "James still remembers you" thing?
	  - That can still be preserved in this approach! However, James now means it as a _threat_ (which Luke / the player does not know, but AL definitely does).
  - What does this mean for the rest of the story?
	  - Luke killing James definitely wasn't part of James' plans. However, Luke is now on his quest to obtain all the artefacts and helps out AL all the same. AL finds out James got killed, but continues to assemble the [[BFS 10000]] anyways since he can just use it to resurrect James now. If the player has a choice in what to do with the [[BFS 10000]] after defeating AL, the true ending entails using it to resurrect James. Who then snatches it and becomes the new big bad.
	  - AL is actually not that evil. To save James he's definitely done some messed up stuff (like abducting [[Sam Ward|Sam]]) but does it out of love for his husbando. And yes, he was definitely morally grey to start out with, but he's like, a respectable type of evil. This may also explain why he spares Luke in their first encounter with [[Case Weston|Case]].
	    James, on the contrary, is now acting purely out of hatred and is just an all-around evil guy. 

sudoMajor: So, are we saying that using the [[BFS 10000]] *doesn't* actually destroy the universe and/or harm Sam?

[Lun]: Good question. How about this: James mainly didn't want AL to try to cast a spell of change fate/resurrection calibre because he thought it would a) just not work and b) be incredibly dangerous and maybe destroy the universe. But then AL invented/found the [[BFS 10000]] which theoretically would actually allow one to cast such a powerful spell without destroying the universe. Since obviously nobody ever tried using it you can't be sure it won't actually destroy the universe, but in theory it should be safe. As for harming Sam, no clue. AL is definitely still evil enough to harm some innocent person for personal gain.

[Sudo]: Of course AL is. But why would Luke use it if it meant harming Sam or anyone else?

[Lun]: Well, as soon as the thing has been assembled, you're not really hurting anyone by using it. But saving Sam does require destroying it (disconnect the SOUL from Sam and then put Sam out of their half-death state). So he would probably not mind using it as long as he can save Sam afterwards ASAP? 

R:: 3
sudo:: Okay, I suppose that makes sense. I guess it depends on how exactly the thing works. (Also, reminder that Sam uses they/them.)
#reply

sudoMajor: Also, what if James and AL's deal is that they can't die unless killed? And that's why AL is so motivated to solve this conundrum—he and James were supposed to have *millennia* together, not just a measly couple of centuries.

[Lun]: That seems like a good reason for AL's obsession with the whole saving thing, and this may also be a good start for their individual backstories. Why where they evil in the first place? Maybe they used [[Longevity (Spell)|some fucked up magic to gain functional immortality (i.e. not aging)]] and had to sacrifice some innocents to accomplish that. Maybe they used like a prototype-BFS 10000 and AL was able to perfect it to the real deal during his stasis?
