%%question:: Why doesn't James just get the Artifacts himself?%%
![[uhhh.jpg]]

>[!idea] What if he's paraplegic?

>[!question] Okay, then why doesn't he just... magic himself up a cure?
>[[Magic]] doesn't work that way?

>[!question] Why not? Why is anyone disabled in a universe where magic exists?
>Just because (almost) anyone can use magic doesn't mean everyone *should*. Magic is dangerous. You're literally tearing holes into the fabric of reality, and if you're not careful, that can have some pretty dire consequences.

>[!note] Maybe [[Sam Ward|Sam]] can't use magic because they don't have a [[SOUL]]

>[!question] So then, wouldn't there be a class of mages who specialize in healing magic? Like doctors?
>Maybe they're really expensive. Like doctors. You think [[James Redawić|James]] can afford that with the money he makes from the [[The Old Silver Mine|museum]]?

>[!question] But James is a powerful mage himself! Why can't he just heal himself? (Or cast Infinite Money?)
>Maybe that's how he became paralyzed in the first place?

>[!idea] Maybe he isn't really paralyzed. Maybe it's an *illusion*
>And [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] naively falls for it

>[!idea] And maybe James is actually working in cahoots with [[CURSED AL]]
>Or wants to make it seem that way and he'll use [[The Legendary Artifacts]] himself and betray AL

>[!question] Okay, so then why can't AL get the artifacts himself?
>Who said he can't? Maybe it *is* like Mother 3, and sometimes AL (or one of his underlings) gets to the artifact first. But, unlike Mother 3, you can't build the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] with just a simple majority of the artifacts. You need all of them.

This makes me feel like we're playing Disco Elysium or something. Maybe I can change the CSS to be DE colors lol. (That would probably be kinda hard to read against a black background.)
