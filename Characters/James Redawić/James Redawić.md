# James, THE DARK MAGICIAN
Perhaps he meddled with something he shouldn’t have and released [[CURSED AL]] from his prison. Former lover of Al?

## James, THE MUSEUM OWNER?
Mysterious and reclusive. Lives in [[Plata]]. Runs a [[The Old Silver Mine|museum]] converted from an abandoned silver mine. Reluctantly trains [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] in the use of [[Magic]].

He's not necessarily rude, but he tends to be laconic, and he doesn't volunteer much information... Unless you're asking him about the mine. He seems to have a different persona he adopts when he's working at the museum. It's not just a job to him; he is, in fact, very passionate about the history of the mine.

## The Enemy of My Enemy Is Not My Friend
He's manipulating Luke into defeating CURSED AL. I mean, you don't date a guy like CURSED AL if you're not at least a little evil yourself. (It wasn't an abusive relationship or anything, btw. They were just both evil.)

[Lun]: Oh, that explains the "James is kind of a bitch" thing

Or maybe CURSED AL is manipulating James into manipulating Luke? James knows where [[Legendary Artifacts]] are because AL told him. James gives this information to Luke so that he can stop AL from making the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] (James does not want to live forever, especially if it means the destruction of the universe), but this does mean that Luke ends up making AL's job easier.

[Lun]: Having someone collect all parts of some cursed machine to stop someone else from collecting them seems to indeed be quite the idiot move. [question:: Is James also dumb?  Or did Luke just misinterpret whatever James said and was then unable to get corrected after James fucking Died™]
[Sudo]: This might be a case of "The author is also an idiot." Maybe the plan *was* for the artifacts to be destroyed, but James was like, "You're still a novice. You won't be able to handle the mana needed to cast [[Destroy Legendary Artifact]], so just bring them back to me, and I'll take care of that." But then, because they're cursed artifacts, James becomes unwilling to destroy them.
[Sudo]: "Oh, pwease don't destwoy us, Mr. Wizard! Think about all the weally cool spells you could cast with us!"
[Sudo]: And James is like, "Hmmm, that's a good point."

[Lun]: I do like the idea of James being a little evil. Corrupt that old man! Also, see what I answered on [[James's Excuse]]

#Cite/Lit/LOTR [litRefType:: LOTR/Items] (??? Only in the sense that the Artifacts have a corrupting influence over their possessor. Imagine if The One Ring talked to its bearer like that lol.)

question:: [[James's Excuse|Why doesn't James just get the artifacts himself?]]

>[!tldr]
>Still this:
>![[wizard that knows fuck all.jpg|300]]
>But possible solutions:
> - He's in a wheelchair, and magic can't/shouldn't be used to heal him
> - He knows he's going to die, so he has to get Luke (or someone, but Luke is convenient) to do it for him
> - He tells Luke that collecting the artifacts is a hazing ritual for new members of [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|The Wizard Club (TM)]] (See: [[Destroy Legendary Artifact]]) (that's not really a motivation, though)
