# Diversity Dragon

Right now (25 May 2023), we have:
- 7 dudes
- 2 enbies
- Just [[Luke's Noble Steed|a regular horse]]
- A dragon of unspecified gender

We need more women. How are we going to have a yuri moment without women?

Wait, I've got it. The Dragon is a lesbian. And in love with the horse. It's like Shrek, except the horse is a horse, of course (of course), and also female. #Cite/Movie/Shrek [movieRefType:: Shrek/Character]

What if it's still just a normal horse, though? The Dragon (whose name is Edna, but that's short for something more suitably draconic) is still in love with it, but the horse cannot love her back because it is a regular horse and not a horse-person. If anything, it's absolutely terrified of Edna, again, because it's a horse.

This leads to one of the more tragic moments in the game: the horse, scared shitless because it is a horse and horses do that, runs away from Edna and breaks a leg in the process. This is also a problem for [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] since, you know, that was his horse, and now he's stranded. (Plus, I mean, if it's actually *his* horse and he didn't just "borrow" it from someone, then he's probably pretty attached to it.)

# Other Notes
- You'd think this is the true main antagonist, but she's actually [[(12) December 2020 Chat Logs#^8a0296|super chill]]
- Tragically in love with Pauline, the horse #Cite/Movie/Shrek [movieRefType:: Shrek/Character]
- Last name is Norwegian for "World killer", but again, she's super chill. Not a case of nominative determinism at all. Plus it sounds funny.
