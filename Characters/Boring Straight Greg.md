# About
The token cishet. Gets his skeleton exploded off-screen.

I know I said there was no significance to the birthdates and they were just randomly generated, but there is a bit of significance to this one. I generated 5 random Mondays from 1980-01-01 to 2000-12-31, and this was one of them. It's perfect because not only is it a Monday, but 1984 was a leap year. So, he was born near the end of February during a leap year, but not on the 29th. I feel like that makes him extra boring.
