## Al, THE SOUL TAKER
With enough [[SOUL|SOULS]], he will become godlike. His essence is eternal, but there has always been someone to banish him. SOULS taken by Al are gradually forgotten until they all but disappear from existence.

What draws people to Al? Not what makes someone willing to forfeit their SOUL, but what are the first steps? Does Al seek them out, or is he summoned?

CURSED AL maybe?
