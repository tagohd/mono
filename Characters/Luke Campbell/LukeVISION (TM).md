alias: colorblind, protanopia

As a dogboy, [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] suffers from protanopia, or red-green colorblindness. Among other things, this causes him to mistake [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]] for an ordinary [[chocolate orange]]. I mean, it's also because he's an idiot, but being colorblind isn't doing him any favors either. (A Legendary Artifact has some distinct vibes it gives off that Luke totally failed to pick up on.)

This isn't directly revealed to the player (unless they're also colorblind, I guess). Like, the game is still colored normally. They just have to figure out that Luke is colorblind when he's told to pick up a blood-red ORB and grabs something orange instead.

We can use [this site](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) to simulate how Luke might see an object. (Put the pictures in the relevant article or here, not in Luke's main article.)

[Lun]: Diversity win! The protagonist is red-green colorblind.
