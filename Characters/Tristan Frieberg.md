[[Case Weston|Case's]] ex-boyfriend

Originally from [[Case Weston (Character Survey)#Current Life]], but I don't think Case would really want to talk about him
- If you’re no longer with your spouse or significant other- describe them here. Why did you split up?
	- **I misjudged his reliability.**
	- In what way?
	- **I couldn't count on him when I needed him the most.**
	- I have a feeling I won't be getting any specifics about that out of you—
	- **Correct.**
	- —but can you tell me more about him in general?
	- **Like what?**
	- His name would be a good start.
	- **Tristan. [[Tristan Frieberg]].** {He says the name as though it literally leaves a bad taste in his mouth.}
	- What else can you tell me about him?
	- **He was on the swim team; think he got a scholarship for it. He had awful taste in movies and a very childish sense of humor. I think he stopped maturing at age 12, and it seemed like he stopped learning then, too. Dumb as a bag of rocks, that one.**
		- {I couldn't decide if he'd be able to keep it together when talking about him. He misses him, but he feels betrayed by him, though part of him knows it's not (entirely) Tristan's fault. Case might get a little choked up talking about it, but he wants to present himself as tough. He's not going to cry over something as stupid as not being able to live with his boyfriend after being kicked out by his parents. Especially not if he (I) rolled a natural 20 on his skill check. (What skill would that even be? Deception? It wasn't a true skill check, anyway. I didn't apply any bonuses; I just rolled a d20. But a nat 20's a nat 20.)}
	- What did you see in him?
	- **I ask myself the same thing.**
		- {Anyway, if Case had failed what I decided was a DC 12 Deception check, he may have admitted one or more of the following: Tristan was physically attractive, a good listener, gave great hugs, was a passionate lover, etc. (Well, he probably wouldn't admit that last one unless he had rolled a nat 1 lol.)
