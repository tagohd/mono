Paragraph 1 moved to [[(Talk) Luke Campbell]].

Paragraph 2 deleted. Outdated, plus plot should probably go in the relevant Plot article.

Luke is 17. He runs cross-country because Sam does, and only because Sam does. He doesn't care much for sports, and he hates running. He helps [[The Mothers Campbell|his parents]] on the farm, but he can't wait to leave [[Genton]] where he can finally be himself. Maybe he (naively) wants to move to [[Rhapsody]]? This possibly contradicts my earlier characterization of Rhapsody, but he's also going there under different circumstances than he imagined. (Also a little bit of [Paris syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome).)

## Various Luke Characterizations
%%
Cf: [[(Talk) Luke Campbell#Various Luke Characterizations]]

Here's what we've definitely agreed on:
%%

- Luke is a dogboy and should not eat chocolate
- Luke wants to eat the chocolate anyway
- Other characters may try to prevent this
- Luke is an idiot
- Luke can disguise the fact that he is a dogboy: ![[tumblr_a95290422c786493948da1b76d44e38c_e848edc9_1280.png]]
- Luke helps various other people on his quest
- Luke saves Case's ass, and Case catches feelings for Luke
- Luke is colorblind

## LukeVISION (TM)
Luke suffers from protanopia, or red-green colorblindness. Among other things, this causes him to mistake [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]] for an ordinary [[chocolate orange]]. I mean, it's also because he's an idiot, but being colorblind isn't doing him any favors either. (A Legendary Artifact has some distinct vibes it gives off that Luke totally failed to pick up on.)

(He's joking, actually, but they *do* appear to be roughly the same color to him.) 

This isn't directly revealed to the player (unless they're also colorblind, I guess). Like, the game is still colored normally. They just have to figure out that Luke is colorblind when he's told to pick up a blood-red ORB and grabs something orange instead. #Gameplay

gameplay:: Show, don't tell when it comes to Luke's protanopia. ([[Luke Campbell#^lukevision|ref]])

We can use [this site](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) to simulate how Luke might see an object. (Put the pictures in the relevant article, not this one.)

## Lucas Progresso

Maybe he has to go into hiding and he changes his name to this at some point?

# Not really THE CHOSEN ONE
Adapted from [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs#^aecda7|(6) June 2023 Chat Logs]]:

What makes Luke special? Why is he THE CHOSEN ONE?

He's not, actually. There is no CHOSEN ONE. [[James Redawić|James]] just says that to everyone hoping they'll help him stop CURSED AL. The only thing that makes Luke special is that he was stupid enough to actually believe James.
#Cite/Unknown [uRefType:: Plot]

This could also set up something of a "No, I am your father" moment when Luke first confronts AL. AL just wipes the floor with Luke (maybe it's one of those scripted battles where you're supposed to lose), and Luke says something like, "How could I have lost? I thought I was THE CHOSEN ONE." And AL's just like:
![[queen of england.jpeg]]
#Cite/Movie/Megamind [movieRefType:: Megamind/Plot]
And he's not even lying. Anyone can use any type of [[Magic#^03cfb6|magic]]. There is nothing special about Luke. Of course, Luke only focuses on that second part, and he completely loses his self-confidence.
^tighten

#Gameplay 
gameplay:: There's a scripted game over against CURSED AL, and AL reveals that Luke was never THE CHOSEN ONE, and James has been manipulating him. ([[Luke Campbell#^tighten|ref]])

I'm sure this represents *some* step on the Hero's Journey, but I'm not sure which one (probably "[[2.4 Atonement with the Father]]"). I just realized the *Star Wars* comparison I referenced in the [[README]] is only about *A New Hope* and not the entire trilogy; this is obviously more like *The Empire Strikes Back*.
#Cite/Movie/Star-Wars 

[Lun]: James is kind of a bitch for this one, but I guess that be how it be sometimes
[Sudo]: Yeah, I'm going to have to come up with some excuse for why he can't just go and do it himself. Maybe he's too busy running the museum?
[Sudo]: Too busy to save the fucking universe? Yeah, I don't think that's gonna fly. But I should probably put this in James's note and not Luke's.
