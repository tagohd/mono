Paragraph 1 moved to [[(Talk) Luke Campbell]].

Paragraph 2 deleted. Outdated, plus plot should probably go in the relevant Plot article.

Luke is 16 (almost 17). He runs cross-country because Sam does, and only because Sam does. He doesn't care much for sports, and he hates running. He helps [[The Mothers Campbell|his parents]] on the farm, but he can't wait to leave [[Genton]] where he can finally be himself. Maybe he (naively) wants to move to [[Rhapsody]]? This possibly contradicts my earlier characterization of Rhapsody, but he's also going there under different circumstances than he imagined. (Also a little bit of [Paris syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome).)

## Various Luke Characterizations
%%
Cf: [[(Talk) Luke Campbell#Various Luke Characterizations]]

Here's what we've definitely agreed on:
%%

- Luke is a dogboy and should not eat chocolate
- Luke wants to eat the chocolate anyway
- Other characters may try to prevent this
- Luke is an idiot
- Luke can disguise the fact that he is a dogboy: ![[tumblr_a95290422c786493948da1b76d44e38c_e848edc9_1280.png]]
- Luke helps various other people on his quest
- Luke saves [[Case Weston|Case's]] ass, and Case catches feelings for Luke
- Luke is colorblind

Here's some new stuff from Discord:
- Kinda competitive
- Tendency to be overly trusting
- Can be very possessive of food and sticks
- Fiercely loyal (see: [[Sam Ward|Sam]])
- Very physically affectionate (\# of times I've mentioned him running up and hugging Case)
  - But also tends to playfight with Case a lot (related?)
  - Related: Is definitely going to need more than a few hugs when this is all over (and probably therapy lol)
- Prone to guilt
- Prone to crying
  - Is he embarrassed by this? I wrote that he wants to look cool in front of Case, but maybe he doesn't think that crying makes him look uncool?
- Is the kind of guy who goes to Renaissance Faires and owns a suit of armor (again, we already knew this one)
- Does not want to kill anyone
  - Moreover, does not want anyone to *be* killed
  - Kinda conflicts with the whole "'accidentally' kills [[James Redawić|James]] and maybe doesn't feel that bad about it" thing?
- Relentless optimist

### Other Questions
See [[Characterization Questions]]

- What is the character's go-to drink order? (How do they like to be publicly perceived?)
	- He's 16? I don't think he really drinks that much. But he wants to be liked, and he wants to present himself as approachable. Plus, he's a farm boy. He probably wouldn't order anything too fancy, but he's also willing to try whatever's recommended to him.
- What is their grooming routine? (How do they treat themselves in private?)
	- He probably showers pretty often, if only to cool down after running, but he also gets dirty doing chores around the farm. Maybe not the best at remembering to put on deodorant or brush his teeth, though. (If they're all animals, maybe deodorant isn't that big of a thing...)
	- I don't think he needs to shave very often yet. Maybe once a week at most.
- What was their most expensive purchase/where does their disposable income go?
	- We've established that he's the kinda guy to go to Renaissance Faires and he owns a suit of armor. So, that's probably his most expensive purchase. He likes swords and knives, too.
- Do they have any scars or tattoos?
	- No tattoos, but he probably has a few scars on his hands and arms from working on the farm and from having "sharp objects" as a hobby. He's probably broken a few bones before, too, likely from falling off of [[Luke's Noble Steed|Pauline]].
- When was the last time they cried, and under what circumstances?
	- Depends on when you ask, because I've already written a few instances of him crying. He cries when he feels scared or hopeless. He also cries during sad movies. He's not afraid to cry.
- Are they an oldest, middle, youngest, or only child?
	- He's an only child.
- Describe the shoes they're wearing.
	- Either running shoes or boots. He lives on a farm, so they tend to be dirty. He cleans them every now and then, but they don't stay clean for long.
- Describe the place where they sleep. (What does their safe space look like?)
	- His room's probably pretty messy. He has a stand for his armor, and probably a few places on the wall(s) for his blades. (Or maybe he doesn't have space to keep all those in his room.) Maybe he has some fantasy art or posters depicting knights and dragons and whatnot. He has a twin (single) bed.
- What is their (least) favorite holiday? (How do they relate to their culture/outside world?)
	- Least favorite: Mother's Day. He has **three** moms! Finding the right gifts for all of them can be very stressful. (Not a big fan of Winterday for similar reasons.)
- What objects do they always carry around with them? (What do they need for their normal, day-to-day routine? What does "normal" even look like for them?)
	- Before the story: He's in school still, so he might get in trouble if he brought a knife. (It's a rural school, though, so they're probably a bit more lax about that.) But he doesn't really carry anything too out of the ordinary most days. Notebooks, pen/pencil, a change of clothes for running, phone, wallet, water bottle. Maybe some ibuprofen for his hips.
## LukeVISION (TM)
Luke suffers from protanopia, or red-green colorblindness. Among other things, this causes him to mistake [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]] for an ordinary [[chocolate orange]]. I mean, it's also because he's an idiot, but being colorblind isn't doing him any favors either. (A Legendary Artifact has some distinct vibes it gives off that Luke totally failed to pick up on.)

(He's joking, actually, but they *do* appear to be roughly the same color to him.) 

This isn't directly revealed to the player (unless they're also colorblind, I guess). Like, the game is still colored normally. They just have to figure out that Luke is colorblind when he's told to pick up a blood-red ORB and grabs something orange instead. #Gameplay 
^lukevision

vnViable:: Show, don't tell when it comes to Luke's protanopia. ([[Luke Campbell#^lukevision|ref]])

We can use [this site](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) to simulate how Luke might see an object. (Put the pictures in the relevant article, not this one.)

## Lucas Progresso

Maybe he has to go into hiding and he changes his name to this at some point?

# Not really THE CHOSEN ONE
Adapted from [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs#^aecda7|(6) June 2023 Chat Logs]]:

What makes Luke special? Why is he THE CHOSEN ONE?

He's not, actually. There is no CHOSEN ONE. [[James Redawić|James]] just says that to everyone hoping they'll help him stop CURSED AL. The only thing that makes Luke special is that he was stupid enough to actually believe James.
#Cite/Unknown [uRefType:: Plot]

This could also set up something of a "No, I am your father" moment when Luke first confronts AL. AL just wipes the floor with Luke (maybe it's one of those scripted battles where you're supposed to lose), and Luke says something like, "How could I have lost? I thought I was THE CHOSEN ONE." And AL's just like:
![[queen of england.jpeg]]
#Cite/Movie/Megamind [movieRefType:: Megamind/Plot]
And he's not even lying. Anyone can use any type of [[Magic#^03cfb6|magic]]. There is nothing special about Luke. Of course, Luke only focuses on that second part, and he completely loses his self-confidence.
^tighten

#Gameplay 
vnViable:: There's a scripted game over against CURSED AL, and AL reveals that Luke was never THE CHOSEN ONE, and James has been manipulating him. ([[Luke Campbell#^tighten|ref]])

I'm sure this represents *some* step on the Hero's Journey, but I'm not sure which one (probably "[[2.4 Atonement with the Father]]"). I just realized the *Star Wars* comparison I referenced in the [[README]] is only about *A New Hope* and not the entire trilogy; this is obviously more like *The Empire Strikes Back*.
#Cite/Movie/Star-Wars 

[Lun]: James is kind of a bitch for this one, but I guess that be how it be sometimes
[Sudo]: Yeah, I'm going to have to come up with some excuse for why he can't just go and do it himself. Maybe he's too busy running the museum?
[Sudo]: Too busy to save the fucking universe? Yeah, I don't think that's gonna fly. But I should probably put this in James's note and not Luke's.
