[[Luke Campbell|Luke's]] parents. Own a [[Campbell Farms|farm]] in [[Genton]]. Not necessarily all dogs.

Unlike most journeys hero, I think it's important that Luke's parents actually stick around through the whole story instead of just, y'know, being dead or being like, "Oh, you're going to save the whole word? That's nice dear," and then just letting Luke fuck off on his own. So, they're kinda like Toriel. They should be worried about him (especially if he's only 16)! But they're also (perhaps reluctantly) supportive of him.

Sudosays:: The Mother 3 reference was supposed to be that they own a farm, not that there are literally 3 mothers.

I'm sure there are several stories that have characters whose parents own a farm. And in the case of Star Wars, they're not even Luke's parentsâ€”they're his aunt and uncle. Does this really need to be cited?
