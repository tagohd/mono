Sudosays:: The Mother 3 reference was supposed to be that they own a farm, not that there are literally 3 mothers.

I'm sure there are several stories that have characters whose parents own a farm. And in the case of Star Wars, they're not even Luke's parentsâ€”they're his aunt and uncle. Does this really need to be cited?
