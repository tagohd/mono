alias: THE ORB, chocolate orange, chocolate oranges
---
Main idea from [[(5) May 2023 Chat Logs#THE ~~CLAW~~ ORB|May 2023 chat logs]].
Cf: [[Luke Campbell#Various Luke Characterizations|Various Luke Characterizations]], [[The Story So Far#^6a412b|The Story So Far]]

What is THE ORB? Is it the secret to CURSED AL'S power? Can it restore your [[SOUL]]? Is it a dragon egg? Or is it really just a chocolate orange? A cursed chocolate orange, perhaps?

Building off the ideas in the [[(5) May 2023 Chat Logs#Behold, THE ORBNGE|chat log]], there's the real orb, and then there's the chocolate orange. Either [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] is too stupid to tell the difference, or he secretly wants both. [[Case Weston|Case]] is smart enough to know the difference, but seeing Luke grab the orange makes him question things. "Was I wrong, or is he really just that stupid?"

Luke really is just that stupid.

Anyway, here's part of a song that might play when you're in the vicinity of THE ORB:
![[Power.mp3]]
It also plays when you acquire THE ORANGE. I say "part of a song" because I want to add some more stuff to it, like a violin perhaps. Maybe you only hear this part when you get THE ORANGE, and you get to hear the whole song when you acquire THE ORB. Though if this were a real game, I'd imagine most players likely wouldn't hear the whole song; it will probably end up being much longer than the scene in which it plays.
