[[Luke Campbell|Luke]] sets out on his journey to fulfill his quest as THE CHOSEN ONE. What causes him to change his mind? [[James Redawić|James’s]] faith in Luke gives him the determination to continue. Of course, knowing that the fate of the world is at stake helps, but Luke’s primary motivation is rescuing [[Sam Ward|Sam]].

Maybe the lost [[SOUL|SOULS]] are forgotten. As Sam’s SOUL is drawn further into [[CURSED AL]]’s control, Luke struggles to remember them. Perhaps it will be a recurring theme that Luke will find something that reminds him of Sam. As he draws closer to his final battle, he’ll remember some detail about them.
