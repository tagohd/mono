Our hero, [[Luke Campbell]], finds out he is THE CHOSEN ONE, the only one who can defeat [[CURSED AL]]. How does he find out? What is Al’s goal, and why must he be stopped? Why is Luke suited to the task?

Al promises eternal life, but it’s really eternal damnation. He will steal your [[SOUL]] and force you to do his bidding. He intends to enslave the whole world. Luke is the only one whose SOUL is strong enough to not only resist Al’s influence, but free everyone else. He must hurry, however. If Al captures enough SOULS, even Luke will not be able to stop him.

>[!question] [aq:: How does Luke learn he is THE CHOSEN ONE?]
>People have been going missing. [[Sam Ward|Someone close to Luke]] disappears. Luke searches for them and learns of Cursed Al. Also, [[James Redawić|James]] tells him he is THE CHOSEN ONE.

>[!question] [aq:: What is CURSED AL's goal, and why must he be stopped?]
>CURSED AL wants to build a [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] which will grant him access to huge amounts of [[Mana]], more than any one person would normally be able to wield. His goal may ultimately be to use this power to resurrect James, although James hasn't actually died yet.

>He needs to be stopped because this plan has a very high chance of destroying the entire universe.

>[!question] [aq:: Why is Luke suited to the task?]
>He isn't. He really, really isn't. He's just a kid. James is manipulating him.
