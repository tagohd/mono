> It wasn’t easy getting here. Think back on the friends you made, and the ones you lost, the hard-earned victories and the embarrassing defeats. You have changed since your journey first began. Was it for the better? Only you can decide. But now, your journey is over. You can finally rest.

Another original piece. I’m not making a video game, but if I was, I imagine this song would go at the end during the final cutscene while the text above displays. The credits start after the song ends, and a different song would play. I guess it was a hard game, huh?
