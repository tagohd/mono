[[Luke Campbell|Luke]] has no choice but to be THE CHOSEN ONE. [[James Redawić|James]] will be his mentor.

>[!question] Does James mentor him because he wants to or because he must?
> A little of both. James is manipulating Luke, but Luke is unrelentingly stupid. Cf:
>- [[James Redawić#The Enemy of My Enemy Is Not My Friend]]
>- [[Another Outline]]
>- [[Luke Campbell#Not really THE CHOSEN ONE]]

>[!question] Have they met previously?
>Probably not, unless we really want to lean into the time-loop thing? I don't think so, though.
