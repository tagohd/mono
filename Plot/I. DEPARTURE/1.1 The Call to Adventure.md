[[1.2 Refusal of the Call|Next]]
# Summary
The hero begins in a situation of normality from which some information is received that acts as a call to head off into the unknown.

# Plot
[[Luke Campbell]] is a fairly normal guy. He lives in a sleepy little farming town called [[Genton]], where he helps [[Ma & Mommy Campbell|his parents]] out on their [[Campbell Farms|farm]]. (What do they grow? And [question:: if everyone's some kind of animal-person, do they still eat meat?]) He's 16. He runs cross-country for his high school, and he hates it. He's never been particularly interested in sports, but given that Genton is a small, mostly rural town, high school football is kinda the main event; consequently, Luke doesn't fit in all that well.

What would he rather do instead? Maybe he's more of a theater kid? Whatever it is, it's something he feels he can't do in Genton. (It might also be good if it's something that ends up being relevant to his quest.) Maybe he feels he just can't be himself here. (This is more just a side-effect of being 16. You might think because it's a farming town that Genton isn't very accepting, but they're actually quite progressive. I mean, they'd have to be if everyone in the story is queer, unless we're just saying only the main characters are queer.) I think his big thing is just that he wants to do something that feels meaningful. If he stays here in Genton, his options are basically: farmer or maybe mechanic.

So, what's the call to adventure? He wakes up one morning, takes care of his farm chores, and goes next door to [[Sam Ward|Sam's]] house to run with them. Sam is also on the cross-country team, but they're actually into it. Actually, maybe they would be the one coming to Luke's house since Luke hates cross-country. (It probably goes without saying, but Sam is the only reason Luke joined the team.) So, when they don't show up to force Luke to exercise, Luke gets worried and goes over to their house to investigate. That's when he discovers that they've disappeared.

Maybe Sam has previously expressed an interest in the occult, or maybe they've always wanted to visit [[The Old Silver Mine|the mining museum]] in [[Plata]]. Something leads Luke to believe that Sam is in Plata and/or that [[CURSED AL]] is involved. Wouldn't it be out of character for them to just leave suddenly and not tell Luke? Luke doesn't think that far ahead. He's impulsive, so once he gets it in his head that Sam is in Plata (whether or not that's actually true), his course is set. (And of course, the player probably wouldn't know that it's out of character for them either.) He saddles up [[Luke's Noble Steed|Pauline]] and sets off up the mountain path.
