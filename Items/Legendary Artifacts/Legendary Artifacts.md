# About
The Legendary Artifacts are objects [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] must retrieve on his quest to defeat [[CURSED AL]].

>[!question] [aq:: How many are there?]
>Let's go with 7. (8 if you count the [[BFS 10000]] itself.)

>[!question] [aq:: What do they do, aside from function as convenient objectives?]
>I don't know what each individual one does by itself, but together they form the [[BFS 10000]], which lets the user handle metric fucktons of [[Mana]]. If I answer these questions, I'll do it in the article for each one instead of here.

>[!question] Are they Horcruxes?
>No. I think Luke needs to gather them all, not destroy them. But they do have some relations to SOULS, and it seems likely that AL can't be defeated without them. And they may hold some personal significance to AL.

>[!question] Are they like the Needles in Mother 3?
>Kinda? Maybe in the sense that gathering them all (or at least a majority) lets you control something. Also in the sense that there's someone else after them. But not in the sense that they disappear when pulled (or that pulling them causes a magical enby to die). #Cite/Game/Mother3 
>
>Oh! Maybe they're like the Infinity Stones. #Cite/Movie/MCU

sudoMajor:: If AL has previously built a prototype [[BFS 10000]], shouldn't he already have most of the Artifacts?

>[!question] If AL has previously built a prototype [[BFS 10000]], shouldn't he already have most of the Artifacts?
>Two possibilities:
>1. After they found out he had cast [[Longevity (Spell)|Longevity]], [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] makes him get rid of The Artifacts as a condition of not putting him in Wizard Jail. The Artifacts are now being researched in various IMAS facilities across the country. This obviously makes it harder for [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] (or anyone else) to acquire them since they're tightly guarded.
>2. After the accident that paralyzed James [citation needed], The Artifacts were magically scattered everywhere. No one knows for sure where they all are.

My idea of the ordeal is that the prototype [[BFS 10000]] was actually just the [[BFS 10000]] but without a bunch of the artefacts stabilising the whole ordeal. So maybe only the [[BLADE OF POWER]] to steal the souls and [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]] to hold them. This is enough to do some big spell casting, but because it's a bunch of separate, (dissipating) SOULs, the whole thing is just kind of a mess. So for the real version, AL needs all of the [[Legendary Artifacts]] to create a single, stable, big fucking soul.

Which reminds me, why is a single big SOUL more stable than a bunch of separate ones? Or can the ORB only hold a single SOUL? But then that would mess with my idea of the mechanism of the prototype version. 
The original reason was that the single big one was still connected to a living host while for the prototype version AL just killed the fools and tried using their SOULs in a hurry (which is also why he messed up the second time). 
But that clashes with the "Sam is only required for the fusion reaction" idea. Though I think you mostly wanted that so Sam could steal the [[BFS 10000]] in the final battle with AL? Maybe we can somehow keep that with Sam still functioning as the living vessel? Or we change the workings of the prototype. Or we invent another reason why the full-artefact version works better than the few-artefact version. Hold on, aren't some of the artefacts ([[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH]], [[BEE]]) specifically made to work with the living vessel idea? So can we even thrash that at this point?

Third and last artefact related point: What if AL made all of them? At the start he only had a few, but then to save James he goes into another realm to create the others? Just an idea I had because a bunch of the artefacts have a use case _very_ specific to the [[BFS 10000]]. I'd say, either that or we go with the option that the artefacts had been created earlier with the specific purpose of creating the [[BFS 10000]], but then who did that and why did the knowledge on how to make it get lost. And how did AL get them all eventually?

---

Yeah, okay, I think I'm going with the idea that they form the [[BFS 10000]] for now. Of course, now I need to figure out what *that* does. But CURSED AL is trying to build one for... reasons. (If CURSED AL isn't the real Big Bad, then it may be likely that his reasons are inscrutable to mere mortals. He's merely carrying out the wishes of some eldritch being, and we all know eldritch beings love acting in ways humans can't even hope to comprehend.) Whatever his reasons, it's going to be very bad if he's successful.

Going yet even further on my [[Magic]] system, perhaps the Legendary Artifacts offer a way to more easily control the veil between planes, thereby allowing the caster to cast more powerful spells without repercussions. Collecting all of them and gaining total control over the veil would essentially make a mage all-powerful, assuming they have the skill to control large amounts of mana (to convert them into spells - otherwise the mana will still go boom). A mage like [[CURSED AL]] would definitely like their hands on these bad boys, perhaps one might even gain enough power to break a CURSE... (Or maybe he really wants to kill someone, like [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder]], assuming she also got his horse killed? Or maybe he wants to revive a certain someone (cough cough [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]]))?

For [[Luke Campbell|Luke]], collecting them might just expand his spell options, considering he's only a beginning mage and is mostly limited in what spells he can cast by the difficulty in stitching the veil.
