# About
The Legendary Artifacts are objects [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] must retrieve on his quest to defeat [[CURSED AL]].

>[!question] [aq:: How many are there?]
>Let's go with 7. (8 if you count the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]].)

>[!question] [aq:: What do they do, aside from function as convenient objectives?]
>I don't know what each individual one does by itself, but together they form the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]], which lets the user handle metric fucktons of [[Mana]]. If I answer these questions, I'll do it in the article for each one instead of here.

>[!question] Are they Horcruxes?
>No. I think Luke needs to gather them all, not destroy them. But they do have some relations to SOULS, and it seems likely that AL can't be defeated without them. And they may hold some personal significance to AL.

>[!question] Are they like the Needles in Mother 3?
>Kinda? Maybe in the sense that gathering them all (or at least a majority) lets you control something. Also in the sense that there's someone else after them. But not in the sense that they disappear when pulled (or that pulling them causes a magical enby to die). #Cite/Game/Mother3

>Oh! Maybe they're like the Infinity Stones. #Cite/Movie/MCU

Yeah, okay, I think I'm going with the idea that they form the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] for now. Of course, now I need to figure out what *that* does. But CURSED AL is trying to build one for... reasons. (If CURSED AL isn't the real Big Bad, then it may be likely that his reasons are inscrutable to mere mortals. He's merely carrying out the wishes of some eldritch being, and we all know eldritch beings love acting in ways humans can't even hope to comprehend.) Whatever his reasons, it's going to be very bad if he's successful.

Going yet even further on my [[Magic]] system, perhaps the Legendary Artifacts offer a way to more easily control the veil between planes, thereby allowing the caster to cast more powerful spells without repercussions. Collecting all of them and gaining total control over the veil would essentially make a mage all-powerful, assuming they have the skill to control large amounts of mana (to convert them into spells - otherwise the mana will still go boom). A mage like [[CURSED AL]] would definitely like their hands on these bad boys, perhaps one might even gain enough power to break a CURSE... (Or maybe he really wants to kill someone, like [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder]], assuming she also got his horse killed? Or maybe he wants to revive a certain someone (cough cough [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]]))?

For [[Luke Campbell|Luke]], collecting them might just expand his spell options, considering he's only a beginning mage and is mostly limited in what spells he can cast by the difficulty in stitching the veil.
