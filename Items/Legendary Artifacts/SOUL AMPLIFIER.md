Okay, yeah, maybe it is some kind of cannon/ORB LAUNCHER. And also it's in space? #Cite/Game/Metroid #Cite/Unknown

Oh, and it needs to have a cool acronym. I'll come up with that after I've figured out more of the details

# From [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs]]
I'll try to keep that in mind, but something about meddling with the primal forces of nature to resurrect a dead loved one is giving me some strong Fullmetal Alchemist vibes #Cite/TV/FMAB  [tvRefType:: FMAB/Plot]

Oh, wait. There's a thought. [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]] is still alive at the beginning of the story, but [[CURSED AL|AL]] is already trying to build the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] to resurrect him. Maybe that ties into the cyclical nature of things. And also the idea I had at the very beginning of things that James was predestined to die

Maybe AL knows he can't prevent James from dying, so he's trying to resurrect him after the fact
And AL is so obsessed with this idea that it leads to their breakup, even though he's (ostensibly) doing it out of love for James

AL's like, "I love you so much that I would tear apart the fabric of the universe to keep you with me", but James is like, "AL, you idiot, we *live* in the universe!"

And there's another potential FMA parallel: the SOUL AMPLIFIER is kinda like the giant transmutation circle, and it's going to draw on the power of everyone's [[SOUL|SOULS]]. #Cite/TV/FMAB  

And CURSED AL is after [[Sam Ward|Sam]] because they're a ginger and therefore don't have a SOUL, so he's going to, like, focus the power of everybody's SOULS onto them and use them as a vessel or something

Sudosays:: I'm going to make sure this is linked every time it's mentioned so that it automatically gets updated everywhere if I change the name. (Except for the one that's inside the flowchart because that breaks the flowchart.)

I don't think tagging the same thing multiple times will really accomplish anything, but it does make it feel more like a citation

First responding to your comment: In case we fail to have this file linked every time when it's mentioned, you can do a vault-wide replace all if you open your vault in [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) and then use the replace-all thing there. Now, for the main course:

# The working mechanism and connection to the [[Legendary Artifacts]]

The goal of the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] is to expand the range of spells a magician can cast to "essentially anything". Since the power of casting [[Magic]] is mainly limited by the amount of [[Mana]] one can store in their [[SOUL]] (though skill is also required to convert the mana to the required spell), the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] accomplishes this by creating an artificial SOUL which can contain HUGE amounts of mana.

Here's how it works:
- Get [[Sam Ward|a sacrificial lamb with no SOUL]]
- Fill this empty vessel with a large collection of other people's SOULs.
	- Stealing and transferring SOULs will require one or two [[Legendary Artifacts]]. Maybe the [[BLADE OF POWER]] is used to separate SOUL from body and then another one to transfer it into the vessel?
	- The vessel may experience lasting incredible anguish, which is why it is not recommended for the caster to use themselves as vessel (in case the caster has no SOUL to begin with)
- Place the vessel in a half-living state to loosen the connection between their SOUL and their body
	- Will require another artefact (maybe a needle or something?)
- Transfer the vessel's SOUL into an artificial vessel, [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]]
	- This is different from the SOUL separations done to fill the vessel, as the vessel may not be killed. While [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]] can contain a SOUL, the SOUL still requires a connection to a living owner lest it starts dissipating (which was previously not an issue because we were going from one living owner to another). So for this step you need yet another artefact (besides the orb)

[Sudo]: Okay, let me make sure I'm following this right. SOULS go out of their original owners, into Sam, and then into THE ORB?

- Connect your own SOUL to [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]]
	- Not sure how this works, maybe you just have to put the orb on [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM|a staff]] (another artefact) and then hold the staff to be connected to the ORB?
- You can now use your store-bought SOUL as if it were your own and cast spells previously beyond imagination!

[Sudo]: Metal af ðŸ¤˜
[Sudo]: Oh, wait, I have a WIP for this...
