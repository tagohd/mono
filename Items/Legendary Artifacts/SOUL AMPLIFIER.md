Okay, yeah, maybe it is some kind of cannon/ORB LAUNCHER. And also it's in space? #Cite/Game/Metroid #Cite/Unknown

Oh, and it needs to have a cool acronym. I'll come up with that after I've figured out more of the details

# From [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs]]
I'll try to keep that in mind, but something about meddling with the primal forces of nature to resurrect a dead loved one is giving me some strong Fullmetal Alchemist vibes #Cite/TV/FMAB  [tvRefType:: FMAB/Plot]

Oh, wait. There's a thought. [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]] is still alive at the beginning of the story, but [[CURSED AL|AL]] is already trying to build the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]] to resurrect him. Maybe that ties into the cyclical nature of things. And also the idea I had at the very beginning of things that James was predestined to die

Maybe AL knows he can't prevent James from dying, so he's trying to resurrect him after the fact
And AL is so obsessed with this idea that it leads to their breakup, even though he's (ostensibly) doing it out of love for James

AL's like, "I love you so much that I would tear apart the fabric of the universe to keep you with me", but James is like, "AL, you idiot, we *live* in the universe!"

And there's another potential FMA parallel: the SOUL AMPLIFIER is kinda like the giant transmutation circle, and it's going to draw on the power of everyone's [[SOUL|SOULS]]. #Cite/TV/FMAB  

And CURSED AL is after [[Sam Ward|Sam]] because they're a ginger and therefore don't have a SOUL, so he's going to, like, focus the power of everybody's SOULS onto them and use them as a vessel or something

Sudosays:: I'm going to make sure this is linked every time it's mentioned so that it automatically gets updated everywhere if I change the name. (Except for the one that's inside the flowchart because that breaks the flowchart.)

I don't think tagging the same thing multiple times will really accomplish anything, but it does make it feel more like a citation
