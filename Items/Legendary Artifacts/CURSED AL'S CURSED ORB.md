# About
A blood-red ORB invented by [[CURSED AL]] to hold recently extracted [[SOUL|SOULS]], allowing the holder to cast spells that require more [[Mana]] than they can physically handle.

# Theme of THE ORB?
Anyway, here's part of a song that might play when you're in the vicinity of THE ORB:
![[Power.mp3]]
%%
songTitle:: Power
songRemarks:: Only piano in this version
%%
It also plays when you acquire THE ORANGE. I say "part of a song" because I want to add some more stuff to it, like a violin perhaps. Maybe you only hear this part when you get THE ORANGE, and you get to hear the whole song when you acquire THE ORB. Though if this were a real game, I'd imagine most players likely wouldn't hear the whole song; it will probably end up being much longer than the scene in which it plays.

If THE ORB is one of many (see: [[1.3 Supernatural Aid]]), what if more instruments get added the more artifacts you acquire?

songRemarks:: Maybe more instruments get added as you acquire more Artifacts
