# Luke is an idiot
Main idea from [[(5) May 2023 Chat Logs#THE ~~CLAW~~ ORB|May 2023 chat logs]].
Cf: [[Luke Campbell#Various Luke Characterizations|Various Luke Characterizations]], [[The Story So Far#^6a412b|The Story So Far]]

question:: What is THE ORB? Is it the secret to CURSED AL'S power? Can it restore your [[SOUL]]? Is it a [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|dragon]] egg? Or is it really just a [[chocolate orange]]? A cursed chocolate orange, perhaps?

Building off the ideas in the [[(5) May 2023 Chat Logs#Behold, THE ORBNGE|chat log]], there's the real orb, and then there's the chocolate orange. Either [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] is too stupid to tell the difference, or he secretly wants both. [[Case Weston|Case]] is smart enough to know the difference, but seeing Luke grab the orange makes him question things. "Was I wrong, or is he really just that stupid?"

Luke really is just that stupid.

## Or is he?
What if he's not stupid? What if he's just [[LukeVISION (TM)|colorblind]]? You know, because he's a dogboy.

"THE ORB", as it appears normally

"THE ORB", as it appears to someone with red-green colorblindness.

No, wait, he's still an idiot. Just less of an idiot. Imagine if the chocolate orange was still in the box. (I am mean to this boy XD)

[Lun]: Yeah, I don't think color blindness is much of an excuse for mistaking a chocolate orange with a powerful cursed artifact, but it's at least _something_ you could cut Luke some slack with. Mostly just dumb though.

sudo:: That's what I was getting at, yes.

# Theme of THE ORB?
Anyway, here's part of a song that might play when you're in the vicinity of THE ORB:
![[Power.mp3]]
%%
songTitle:: Power
songRemarks:: Only piano in this version
%%
It also plays when you acquire THE ORANGE. I say "part of a song" because I want to add some more stuff to it, like a violin perhaps. Maybe you only hear this part when you get THE ORANGE, and you get to hear the whole song when you acquire THE ORB. Though if this were a real game, I'd imagine most players likely wouldn't hear the whole song; it will probably end up being much longer than the scene in which it plays.

If THE ORB is one of many (see: [[1.3 Supernatural Aid]]), what if more instruments get added the more artifacts you acquire?

![[Power2.mp3]]
%%
songTitle:: Power (1)
songRemarks:: Maybe more instruments get added as you acquire more Artifacts
