alias: THE BEE, CALAMITOUS BEE
Location: Unknown
Purpose: "Its venom is a key ingredient for the &quot;poison of near-death&quot;."
Description: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. It's wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

It doesn't matter what Huey Lewis says. It is *not* hip to fuck this bee.

Maybe it's actually a briefcase of bees.
