# Purpose/Function
Uses the [[Legendary Artifacts]] to allow the user to handle extreme amounts of [[Mana]] that would otherwise vaporize their [[SOUL]]. May also summon a large swarm of [[BEE|BEES]] from the [[BEE PLANE]]? (BEEBY DEEBY?)

## SOUL Extraction
When you kill someone with [[BLADE OF POWER|THE BLADE]], their [[SOUL]] goes *ZORP* and gets absorbed by THE BLADE.

THE BLADE can only contain one SOUL at a time, but you can draw on the power of any SOUL so contained as long as you wield THE BLADE.

## SOUL Transfer
How do you get a SOUL out of the BLADE OF POWER?

1. Kill someone else. The previous SOUL dissipates as it is replaced by the new one.
	1. SOULS really don't like not being contained by something.
2. Touch THE BLADE to a vessel, e.g. [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]]. The SOUL is not guaranteed to remain stable when transferred this way.
	1. Maybe you have to use some sort of spell for this, or it has to be a specialized vessel. Otherwise, any inanimate object you touch with THE BLADE would just immediately become haunted.
3. Touch [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]] to THE BLADE. The SOUL contained therein goes *SCHLOOP* as it travels up the needle via capillary action. Transferring SOULS this way keeps them more stable. You can even transfer them into a living vessel. See below.

### Transfer into Living Vessel
An extremely risky procedure. The vessel must be in a state of near-death, loosening the connection between the vessel's body and their own SOUL. If this is not done or if it is performed incorrectly, the vessel may reject the foreign SOUL(s), often violently.

Currently, the best method for this is as follows:
1. Extract raw venom from the [[BEE|CALAMITOUS BEE]] (Southern variety preferred, but other varieties will also work)
	1. How best to extract the venom is left as an exercise for the reader
2. Distill the venom. Certain compounds must be removed from the venom, or the final potion will be fatal instead of only nearly-fatal.
3.

songRemarks:: You've already heard this one. I uploaded it to Tumblr. But it was in October 2021, so maybe you forgot.

Lun: I remember hearing it, but I kinda forgot what it sounded like, so this is about 50% of a new song to me which I will take as a victory!
