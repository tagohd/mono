# Purpose/Function
Uses the [[Legendary Artifacts]] to allow the user to handle extreme amounts of [[Mana]] that would otherwise vaporize their [[SOUL]]. May also summon a large swarm of [[BEE|BEES]] from the [[BEE PLANE]]? (BEEBY DEEBY?)

songTitle:: SOUL Beneficiary
songRemarks:: You've already heard this one. I uploaded it to Tumblr. But it was in October 2021, so maybe you forgot.

Lun: I remember hearing it, but I kinda forgot what it sounded like, so this is about 50% of a new song to me which I will take as a victory!
