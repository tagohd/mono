I'll try to keep that in mind, but something about meddling with the primal forces of nature to resurrect a dead loved one is giving me some strong Fullmetal Alchemist vibes #Cite/TV/FMAB  [tvRefType:: FMAB/Plot]

Oh, wait. There's a thought. [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]] is still alive at the beginning of the story, but [[CURSED AL|AL]] is already trying to build the [[BFS 10000]] to resurrect him. Maybe that ties into the cyclical nature of things. And also the idea I had at the very beginning of things that James was predestined to die

Maybe AL knows he can't prevent James from dying, so he's trying to resurrect him after the fact
And AL is so obsessed with this idea that it leads to their breakup, even though he's (ostensibly) doing it out of love for James

AL's like, "I love you so much that I would tear apart the fabric of the universe to keep you with me", but James is like, "AL, you idiot, we *live* in the universe!"

And there's another potential FMA parallel: the BFS 10000 is kinda like the giant transmutation circle, and it's going to draw on the power of everyone's [[SOUL|SOULS]]. #Cite/TV/FMAB  [tvRefType:: FMAB/Plot]

And CURSED AL is after [[Sam Ward|Sam]] because they're a ginger and therefore don't have a SOUL, so he's going to, like, focus the power of everybody's SOULS onto them and use them as a vessel or something

# The working mechanism and connection to the [[Legendary Artifacts]]

The goal of the [[BFS 10000]] is to expand the range of spells a magician can cast to "essentially anything". Since the power of casting [[Magic]] is mainly limited by the amount of [[Mana]] one can store in their [[SOUL]] (though skill is also required to convert the mana to the required spell), the [[BFS 10000]] accomplishes this by creating an artificial SOUL which can contain HUGE amounts of mana.

Here's how it works:
- Get [[Sam Ward|a sacrificial lamb with no SOUL]]
- Fill this empty vessel with a large collection of other people's SOULs.
	- Stealing and transferring SOULs will require one or two [[Legendary Artifacts]]. Maybe the [[BLADE OF POWER]] is used to separate SOUL from body and then another one to transfer it into the vessel?
	- The vessel may experience lasting incredible anguish, which is why it is not recommended for the caster to use themselves as vessel (in case the caster has no SOUL to begin with) ^fa90fa
- Place the vessel in a half-living state to loosen the connection between their SOUL and their body
	- Will require another artefact (maybe a needle or something?) ^needle-ref
- Transfer the vessel's SOUL into an artificial vessel, [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]]
	- This is different from the SOUL separations done to fill the vessel, as the vessel may not be killed. While [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]] can contain a SOUL, the SOUL still requires a connection to a living owner lest it starts dissipating (which was previously not an issue because we were going from one living owner to another). So for this step you need yet another artefact (besides the orb)

[Sudo]: Okay, let me make sure I'm following this right. SOULS go out of their original owners, into Sam, and then into THE ORB?

[Lun]: Yes, except that the SOULs don't really go out of Sam entirely. They go into the orb but are still connected to the living vessel, otherwise they would disappear. Also, I'd imagine the SOULs are fused when they enter the same vessel, so Sam just gets one giant SOUL which is then carried in the orb. (Maybe because the SOUL is so huge it can still connect to its owner even while away from them? It's like part of the SOUL is used to construct a link between Sam and the orb, but because the SOUL is so vast it doesn't diminish much of its power. To maybe make it more clear: the SOUL is like a big ball of yarn, and it always needs to be connected to the owner by a thread or it disappears. With a normally sized soul you can't go very far or you unwind the whole SOUL and have nothing left over, but with a MEGA SOUL you can go almost anywhere and still have most of the yarn in your orb.)


[Sudo]: That seems a bit convoluted, but I don't have any better ideas. Just to be clear, the original owners of the SOULS die in this process, right? The SOUL is severed from their body so it can be put into Sam? Maybe we need to think more about how exactly the SOUL relates to using magic/mana. (Oh, I think I missed where you said that in the first paragraph. So, the SOUL is like a mana capacitor? )

Lun: Exactly, the original owners of the souls get fucking murdered. Brutally. And yes^2, the soul is kind of like a bucket you can fill with mana which prevents the mana from going haywire. For a little while at least, which is why you should always use all mana in your soul and ASAP after getting it in your bucket least your bucket explodes. Hold on, maybe this is why [[Sam Ward|Sam]] doesn't have their soul (anymore)??
Oh and yes the final step where you put the SOUL in the orb but it's still connected to the living vessel is a bit convoluted, but it's the only way I could make that idea work while keeping Sam alive (for now). If you have any other more elegant fixes, go crazy.

- Connect your own SOUL to [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]]
	- Not sure how this works, maybe you just have to put the orb on [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM|a staff]] (another artefact) and then hold the staff to be connected to the ORB?
- You can now use your store-bought SOUL as if it were your own and cast spells previously beyond imagination!

[Sudo]: Oh, wait, I have a WIP for this...

## Idea
Basically, it just seems like Sam is kinda redundant in this capacity. Why can't AL just put the SOULS in his own body? What's the significance of Sam not having a SOUL of their own?

Lun:
>The answer to both of those questions is that you need a person without a SOUL to house other people's SOULs. Also this [[BFS 10000#^fa90fa]].
>Though I guess there is no explanation for why you can fuse SOULs inside a person with no SOUL to begin with, and you can't just fuse more SOULs onto your own SOUL (of you, a SOUL-haver). Except for the excruciating pain thing, which may suffice. Or maybe a person holding multiple SOULs just can't really function in a normal way (pretty much only works as a SOUL-bag at that point), which is why you need to use another person. But then you run into the problem again why that person can't start out with a SOUL...
>OH, got an idea. What if one of the [[Legendary Artifacts]] is actually an artificial SOUL with the power to absorb other SOULs, which is what AL puts into Sam. He needs someone without a SOUL, because you can't have multiple SOULs in one person. As soon as this SOUL is in Sam, any further SOULs he feeds to Sam are absorbed into the Artifact SOUL, thereby they still only have one. AL also couldn't put this Artifact SOUL into himself because his own SOUL would be absorbed, which would probably be bad.

Not to rip off FMA too much, but maybe the end goal is that AL turns Sam into a living ~~philosopher's stone~~ SOUL AMPLIFIER. #Cite/TV/FMAB [tvRefType:: FMAB/Plot]


Oh! Here's a thought (or 12):

1. [[Sam Ward|Sam]] does actually have a [[SOUL]]. Forget I said they didn't. So why does AL kidnap them? No real reason; they were just convenient. Maybe he slightly fucked up exiting the "stasis" dimension and came out in [[Genton]] instead of [[Plata]]. (They're only ~40km apart, so not that big of a mistake.) Oh, actually, what if he comes out IN Sam's house? ^c9847f
2. The SOUL acts like a capacitor for [[mana]]. SOULS, in general, don't tend to tolerate mana very well, but you can learn to improve your tolerance. This is why novice mages can only cast weak spellsâ€”they haven't built up enough to tolerance to be able to handle the higher levels of mana required by more powerful spells.
	1. If it really acts like a capacitor, you could theoretically collect the mana in advance. There would have to be some limits to this, though. Maybe Mana decays over time, or storing it in your SOUL without using it is really uncomfortable.
		1. This could be represented by the player having to hold down a button to charge their mana. You can maintain your charge for as long as you can hold \[Y\], but it's going to make pressing other buttons awkward, especially if there's a platforming section or something. Or maybe it's like a weapon with an overcharge. The mana is coming out whether you want it to or not, so you'd better have a spell ready unless you want to take damage.
		2. Higher spellcasting level = higher tolerance to Mana = can hold charge longer #Gameplay 
		3. "average person can tolerate 3,000 Mâ‹…C[^1] of mana" factoid actually just statistical error. average person can tolerate 0 Mâ‹…C. [[Manas Georg]], who lives in cave & can tolerate over 10,000,000 Mâ‹…C, is an outlier adn should not have been counted. #Cite/Meme/Spiders-Georg [memeRefType:: Spiders Georg/Character]
3. It is generally not possible for multiple mages to cast the same spell in parallel. ^parallel-casting
	1. Example: A spell requires 500 Mâ‹…C of Mana to cast. [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] can tolerate 200 Mâ‹…C. [[Case Weston|Case]] can tolerate 300 Mâ‹…C. They cannot pool their mana together to cast the spell.
	2. Example: Let's say it costs 150 Mâ‹…C to cast [[Magic Missile]] at the first level and 50 additional Mâ‹…C per higher level. Case cannot lend Luke 50 Mâ‹…C so that Luke can cast it at the second level.
4. [[Reverse Fate]] (which is basically just a modified version of [[Wish]]) requires *obscene* amounts of mana to cast. More than even Manas Georg could tolerate.
5. The SOUL AMPLIFIER allows for parallel casting, thus making it possible to cast absurdly powerful spells like Reverse Fate. It works by unifying multiple SOULS into one body. It's still a work in progress, so AL wants to test it on Sam first before using it on himself.
	1. AL built a similar device when casting [[Longevity (Spell)|Longevity]], but maybe it broke when he tried to cast it on James. This time around, he's had a few hundred additional years to perfect the design.
6. (This is near the end of the game.) After successfully using the SOUL AMPLIFIER, AL has Sam enthralled and attempts to force them to cast a lesser spell as a trial run. Luke and Case intervene. Luke calls out to Sam's SOUL, but they're too far gone.
7. It's clear that despite all their training, Case and Luke are *still* no match for AL. Luke is exhausted and badly wounded, but Case has an idea. He'll distract AL long enough for Luke to cast some healing spells on himself, and then he'll... do something to the SOUL AMPLIFIER? AL (via Sam) casts [[Greater Fuck You Up Big Time]] in Case's general direction, but it also hits one of the [[Legendary Artifacts]] and part of the spell ricochets back towards AL. #Cite/Game/Mega-Man-X #Cite/Game/Mother3 [gameRefType:: "Mega Man X/Plot", "Mother 3/Plot"]
8. With AL's concentration broken, his grip on Sam loosens, and Luke is able to reach out to their SOUL. (Figuratively, I hope.) It's too late, however. The effects of the SOUL AMPLIFIER cannot be undone. #Cite/Game/Undertale [gameRefType:: Undertale/Plot]
9. AL fires back at Luke. Luke dodges, but still takes major damage. Even with their new BIG SOUL, AL is forcing Sam to use more mana than their physical form can handle (something AL did not anticipate). He'll have to spare Luke for now so that he can cast Reverse Fate before Sam's body disintegrates.
10. James is dead. Case is dead. Some other characters I haven't written yet are dead. And Luke is about to be dead, too, if he doesn't act fast. There's only one solution. With the last of his strength, he calls out to Sam's SOUL once more:
>![[Luke Call Out.png]]
>(The player doesn't get to hear what Luke said.)
11. The screen flashes a couple times, then we see Sam's reply:
>![[Sam Reply 1.png]]
>![[Sam Reply 2.png]]
>The music swells.
>![[Game Boy Screen.png]]
>The screen fades to "white". #Cite/Game/Omori ? [gameRefType:: Omori/Plot]
12. [[Luke Campbell]] is a fairly normal guy. He lives in a sleepy little farming town called [[Genton]], where he helps [[The Mothers Campbell|his parents]] out on their [[Campbell Farms|farm]]. He's 17. He runs cross-country for his high school, and he hates it. He's never been particularly interested in sports, but given that Genton is a small, mostly rural town, high school football is kinda the main event; consequently, Luke doesn't fit in all that well. His next door neighbors are the Wards. They don't have any children.
13. Credits roll. That's the end of the game.
14. Psych! There's a way to get Sam back, but I haven't figured out what it is yet.

Lun:
>Alright, so the whole parallel-casting thing pretty much comes down to the same as filling one vessel with a bunch of souls. Having to carry Sam around as the conduit rather than the orb does make it a bit more elegant (though also kinda funny).
>I think it works really well for the ending scene too! 
>But maybe instead of parallel casting you can keep the "one artefact SOUL absorbing other SOULs"? It works just as well with the "Sam becomes a living SOUL AMPLIFIER" thing but lets you keep the "Sam needs to have no SOUL" thing.
>We already pulled a "he just walked into this random guy and decided to use him for his evil plans" with Luke, so maybe we shouldn't for Sam as well. Though I guess he could have targeted Luke for being Sam's best friend, and Sam is the one primeval "random guy he decided to use".
>To conclude: I think we can kind of mash both SOUL AMPLIFIER ideas to have the best of both worlds here.

1. Here I go spoiling old games again (Mother 3), but I was thinking of it like: AL is Porky Minch[^2] and Sam is like Claus/The Masked Man (except they're not Luke's twin). They're not being carried around as much as they are completely under AL's control.
2. Artificial SOUL is a cool idea (also sounds like a good band name). Maybe that's what AL was working on in "stasis"?
3. I'm not sure I want to keep the "Sam needs to have no SOUL" thing, though. Their having a SOUL seems kinda integral to the whole "Luke calls out to Sam's SOUL to break them free from AL's control" deal. Actually, I already have something of an idea for the song that would play there:

![[mus_xpart_2.ogg]]

[^2]: I guess that makes [[Emperoress, The|The Emperoress]] Giygas?

### Saving Sam (NG+)
sudoMajor:: What happens next
#majorChange #unseenByLun 

[[Sam Ward|Sam]] uses the [[BFS 10000]] to cast [[Reverse Fate]], rewinding the timeline to the beginning but erasing themself from existence in the process. This has some other knock-on effects on the timeline.

After the reset, [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] wakes up in his bed. He is no longer getting ready to go to the [[1.1 The Call to Adventure#^c8c6a1|Renaissance Festival]]. Instead, he's getting ready for a track and field meet at [[Plata]] High School, where he meets [[Case Weston|Case]].[^3] Luke and Case both realize something is majorly *off*.
[^3]: Case still being in high school is one of the aforementioned knock-on effects.

Somehow, they learn they have to go to [[Eeby Deeby]] and defeat [[Emperoress, The|The Emperoress]]. (So, The Emperoress is The Radiance, not [[CURSED AL]].) And then they're able to restore the timeline? Idk, that's all I have right now.

Oh! I remembered another idea I had. I had mentioned in [[1. Plot Overview#^e55ca3]] that maybe [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]] shouldn't die too soon since he can teach Luke more spells. So, what if he lives in the first timeline, but Luke accidentally kills him in *this* timeline?

[James]: How familiar are you with spells, young one?
[Luke]: I think I know [[Magic Missile]]?
[James]: Show me.
[Luke]:  *casts [[Greater Fuck You Up Big Time]]\*

And that's when he realizes what happened.
