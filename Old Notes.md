# Characters
## Luke Campbell
### Age
(Carried over from [[Sam Ward#Characterizations]])
* They're about Luke's age, so... 16-17? (I haven't really decided how old Luke is, either.)
	[Lun]: Considering the significant amount of Luke-centered romance in this story, how about him being an adult? Like 20 or so?
	[Sudo]: Yeah, that can work. I went with Luke being 16 based off the scrapped idea that he turns into a dogboy instead of always being one, and he's such an idiot that he thinks it's Puberty 2: Electric Boogaloo. (Although, the older he is, the funnier that would be.)

Wait, actually I'm not sure if that can work. That breaks a lot of dependencies, so to speak. Luke and Sam being on the cross-country team doesn't really make sense, for one. Sure, they could be on the college team, but [[Genton]] doesn't have a college. I guess they just run for fun? (Well, Sam does, anyway.)

And why do they both still live with their parents? I'm not sure how well everything I wrote in [[1.1 The Call to Adventure]] would work if Luke was older.

---
Okay, let's look at it this way: Luke's out of high school. What does that affect?

>[!question] Luke still wants to leave Genton. Why hasn't he already left?
>Possible reasons:
>- Parents need his help on the farm
>- Can't afford to move out
>	- They own at least one horse, possibly more, and horses are expensive. Just because they live in the country doesn't mean they're poor. And we still don't know what they grow on their farm.
>	- Counterpoint: Maybe they're spending all their money on the horses
>- Doesn't think he's smart enough to go to college/college wouldn't be a good fit for him
>- Saving up money to go to college
>- College is out for the summer
>	- I like this one, actually. If he's already in college, I might not have to change that much. But then I'd have to figure out what he's studying.
>	- It would also explain why Sam is still in Genton. They're home for the summer, too.
>- Dropped out of college
>	- *Night in the Woods* reference?
>- D E P R E S S I O N
>	- *Night in the Woods* reference? (I still haven't beaten that game either.)
>- Doesn't know what he wants to do, just knows he doesn't want to stay in Genton

>[!info] Luke can now go to [[Genton#Boringsville at Night|the lounge]].
>The lounge kinda sucks, though. The band seemingly only knows that one song. (Don't they ever get tired of playing it?) Plus, it reeks of stale cigar smoke and cheap beer.

>[!question] Why does he take the horse? He's definitely old enough to drive.
>It'd be one thing if he was 16. You could say he hasn't gotten his license yet, or he doesn't have his own car.
>
>Possible reasons:
>- Can't drive
>- Car is a piece of shit
>	- Maybe he should cross off "mechanic" from his list of possible careers
>- Forgot he had a car because he's an idiot
>- Just really likes riding his horse (and [[Plata]] isn't actually that far away; definitely too far to walk, though)
>	- Environmentally friendly!

sudoMajor: Yeah, okay, let's say he's 19 and he's back home after his first year in college. (Or maybe it's winter break.) And I'll age everyone else (i.e. Sam and Case) up accordingly.
Lunsays:: Actually, I don't mind him being younger that much on second thought. It's not like we were going to put explicit scenes in this story. Right?!
Sudosays:: Correct. 1) It's not that kind of game. 2) I wouldn't be comfortable writing that regardless of the characters' ages. I guess I'll change everyone's ages again?
