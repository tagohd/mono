>Maybe [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] isn't an idiot as much as he's just naÃ¯ve (he's still a little bit of an idiot, though). As seen in [[1.4 The Crossing of the First Threshold#Wherein Luke and Case Find THE ORB|1.4 The Crossing of the First Threshold]], he knows the [[Chocolate Orange]] isn't really THE ORB. He was just joking. But he really is [[LukeVISION (TM)|colorblind]].

Main idea from [[(5) May 2023 Chat Logs#THE ~~CLAW~~ ORB|May 2023 chat logs]].
Cf: [[Luke Campbell#Various Luke Characterizations|Various Luke Characterizations]], [[The Story So Far#^6a412b|The Story So Far]]

>[!question] What is THE ORB? Is it the secret to CURSED AL'S power? Can it restore your [[SOUL]]? Is it a [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|dragon]] egg? Or is it really just a [[Chocolate Orange]]? A cursed chocolate orange, perhaps?
>THE ORB is a container for SOULS.

Building off the ideas in the [[(5) May 2023 Chat Logs#Behold, THE ORBNGE|chat log]], there's the real orb, and then there's the chocolate orange. Either [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] is too stupid to tell the difference, or he secretly wants both. [[Case Weston|Case]] is smart enough to know the difference, but seeing Luke grab the orange makes him question things. "Was I wrong, or is he really just that stupid?"

Luke really is just that stupid.

## Or is he?
What if he's not stupid? What if he's just [[LukeVISION (TM)|colorblind]]? You know, because he's a dogboy.

"THE ORB", as it appears normally

"THE ORB", as it appears to someone with red-green colorblindness.

No, wait, he's still an idiot. Just less of an idiot. Imagine if the chocolate orange was still in the box. (I am mean to this boy XD)

[Lun]: Yeah, I don't think color blindness is much of an excuse for mistaking a chocolate orange with a powerful cursed artifact, but it's at least _something_ you could cut Luke some slack with. Mostly just dumb though.

[Sudo]: That's what I was getting at, yes.
