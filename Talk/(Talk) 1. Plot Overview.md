>Oooh, what if [[Longevity (Spell)]] sets a sort of "death countdown" when casting it, and when it runs out (i.e. the magic used in the casting runs out), you die / brutally implode. Normally this is a _very long_ countdown, but something went wrong while casting Longevity on James and he got a much shorter duration (still a few centuries, but not the usual millennia). Also gives AL another reason to be so obsessed with saving James: he essentially caused his impending doom by messing up the spell.

**Sudo:**
>Maybe I should make them a couple hundred years older, huh? Also, I like this idea, but it seems to conflict with Luke being the one to kill James. (I have been kind of rethinking that, though. James is useful to keep around because who else is going to teach Luke new spells? At the very least, Luke probably kills him later than I initially intended, in which case he's not like Toriel.) ^3d7c01

**Lun:**
>Alright hear me out on this one. What if [[James RedawiÄ‡\|James]] gets killed in the first loop, which causes AL to successfully collect all parts of the [[BFS 10000\|SOUL AMPLIFIER]], get in a big final fight with [[Luke Campbell\|Luke]] and then get RESET on by [[Sam Ward\|Sam]]. In the next loop however, Luke does _not_ kill James (not sure how this comes to be, maybe his sense of "something is wrong" makes him act more carefully?). This allows Luke to learn more advanced magic in the next loop and also changes the final boss fight to James, as he kills AL and takes the [[BFS 10000\|SOUL AMPLIFIER]] if he survives.

**Sudo:**
>Hmmm... very, very interesting. I like it.

>Hating running is very out of character for a dogboy. This is good, because I don't want all characters to blindly take over the traits of their animal species. Get some differences in there.

**Sudo:**
>There's a reason for this. There wasn't when I wrote that, but there is now: Luke has mild hip dysplasia. He doesn't know it, though. Running is just supposed to be kinda painful, right? (See: [[1.1 The Call to Adventure#^5d7e02]])

Lun:
> So in game you travel at a brisk walking pace and when you dash around the screen too much you start taking DoT? :V

Sudo:
> DoT? Oh, damage over time. Maybe? It's non-fatal damage, though, so I'm not sure how you would represent that in-game. Maybe your overall move speed is reduced for a bit if you dash too much (Luke is sore), or you become more likely to miss (Luke's couldn't focus on aiming because he's in pain). I don't think it would directly impact your HP, though.

Lun: 
> Me: If I make a game I want it to be with a lot of mobility and dashing! Sudo: The protagonist has the hips of a grandma. He _will_ die if you dash over twice in a row. (\* only slightly exaggerated) ^b2b21c

Sudo: 
> Only slightly

gameplay:: Move speed is occasionally limited by Luke's hip dysplasia. Is this inconvenient? Yes, but so are actual disabilities. ([[(Talk) 1. Plot Overview#^b2b21c|ref]])

Lun: 
> I guess you could have a cooldown after dashing multiple times, that can work gameplay-wise. ^r5

sudo:: Yeah, that makes sense. Plus, as a cross country runner, Luke is more geared towards long distance anyway, rather than short sprints. That's the extent of my knowledge about cross country, at least. Also, please don't delete the ref links from the Gameplay notes. ([[(Talk) 1. Plot Overview#^r5|ref]])

>Their first encounter post-stasis seems like a difficult scene to write. Why does James not kill him on sight? We've established he pretty much hates him that amount. Is he too weak to even try? Or is he more a cold and calculating kinda guy?

**Sudo:**
>I will have to think about this some more. Maybe Grigori tempered him out a little. Or maybe AL was aware that James might be *just a little bit upset* and had the foresight to confront him in public. James isn't stupid enough to kill a man in broad daylight. (Alternatively, that wasn't the only thing AL was working on, and James does, in fact, try to kill him in broad daylight, but it doesn't work.)

**Lun:**
>I feel like confronting your hubby/ex(?) about a VERY emotional subject in public would not be a good idea if you want to get back with them. Then again, AL may not be the most emotionally intelligent person.

**Sudo:**
>AL: Heyyyy, bestie! I know it's been 20+ years since I last saw you, but I think I figured out how to save your life!

>Hold on, so James thinks of constructing the BFS 10000 independently of it being AL's grand plan to save James? Or he finds out about AL wanting to make one and acts like it's his idea? Also, why would the IMAS fund that, it relies on sacrificing a bunch of people as part of the construction?!

**Sudo:**
>There's a simple explanation for this seeming contradiction: it was 4am when I wrote it. Maybe James lies and claims to have found a way to make one without killing a bunch of people?

**Lun:**
>Lies are always a possible solution. I'd imagine James wouldn't want AL to know he's also after the [[BFS 10000]] though, that might tick him off right? Or will he try to sell that as "helping" to AL?

**Sudo:**
>Another long one
>
>Yeah, maybe we won't go with that idea. Maybe we go off my initial idea that James wants to destroy the Artifacts, except he's lying and actually building his own [[BFS 10000]]? Luke never actually sees the Artifacts get destroyed, but he believes James anyway.
>
>Oh! Here's an idea: Case works for IMAS, right? What if he's like, "If I bring these Artifacts to IMAS, I will get a good grade in intern, something that is both normal to want and possible to achieve"? Except bringing them to IMAS inadvertently makes it really easy for AL to find them. So, whenever you get an Artifact, you have a choice:
>	1. Give them to James, who does *something* with them (unless he's dead)
>	2. Give them to Case, who turns them into IMAS for a small amount of money (you get brownie points with Case, but James doesn't like this)
>		1. Could also be an alternative way of learning spells if James is dead (See: [[1. Plot Overview#^3d7c01]])
>	3. [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs#^sell-the-artifacts|Sell them for a LOT of money]] (this negatively affects your relationships with both Case and James[^James])
>	4. Keep them for yourself (they're Cursed Artifacts, so this probably isn't a great idea; this also negatively affects your relationships with Case and James)
>	5. ~~Speedrun strat: Give them to CURSED AL directly~~

[^James]: Not that you can date James, but maybe this limits the spells he teaches you?
#Gameplay ^artifact-shenanigans

vnViable:: "What you do with the Artifacts (viz. sell, give to James, give to IMAS, or keep) affects your relationships with the other characters.", "Luke may have some agency re: keeping the Artifacts/keeping the Artifacts has adverse effects, but also unlocks evil dialogue options. ([[(Talk) 1. Plot Overview#^artifact-shenanigans|ref]])"

>Possible effects of keeping the Legendary Artifacts
>	- Maybe the [[BLADE OF POWER]] gives you +10 ATK but reduces your max HP, the [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM]] increases your Mana but lowers your DEF, the [[BEE]] attacks anyone around (including you), etc.
>	- Random attacks from AL's henchmen become more common
>	- Other random Bad Things (TM) become more likely
>		- OneShot-esque glitch effects?
>	- Unlocks Evil dialogue options, but negatively affects your relationships with *everyone* (similar to having negative Karma in Fallout)
>		- The effect goes both ways. Luke becomes paranoid, and other people start to think he gives off bad vibes. This is in addition to hurting your relationships with Case and James by not doing what they want.
>	- Luke just does NOT want to keep them. (If we decide to go "Fuck the fourth wall", making him keep them anyway negatively affects his relationship with *you*. Hopefully, this also makes the player feel bad.)
>		- At the very least, it becomes obvious that Luke is not having a good time. Similar to being homesick in Earthbound where you waste turns not attacking because Ness is too busy thinking about Steak or something.
>		- As it progresses, maybe Luke just outright refuses to obey your commands. You clearly don't have his best interests at heart, so why should he listen to you? This could be a way to force the player into choosing one of the other options.

**Lun:**
>_Reasonably_ long indeed. I do like the idea of having options of what to do with the artefacts and having a karma-meter thing, similar to the Fable games (another reference?!). This will make writing the story a bit more difficult (especially for how AL gets them from IMAS), but might be worth it. The karma thing will also involve writing a lot of alternate dialogue but hey we've been writing quite a lot already anyway. Also, should we try to decide on the fourth wall thing? Does it have a canon explanation like in OneShot?

**Sudo:**
>Never played Fable, actually, so that reference is unintentional. I'll reply more in-depth later. (continues...)

>Okay, it is later.

>**Re: How does AL acquire the Artifacts from IMAS?**
>>Remember when I said that maybe AL and James used to be prominent members of IMAS? I said it [[1. Plot Overview#^i-hope-you-remember-this-because-it-was-right-here|here]] and [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences#^i-also-mentioned-it-here|here]] in case you forgot. Well, my new idea isn't that they were merely once well-respected members, but they literally fucking [[2. Plot Overview (Again)#^the-founders|founded it]]. They still get kicked out, though. And for as much as IMAS would like you to believe that they've changed their ways and have nothing to do with evil wizards like AL and James (perhaps even going so far as to try and retcon their history to say they were founded by an anonymous group of wizards), AL still holds a fair amount of sway with them, and James may or may not be [[2. Plot Overview (Again)#^pension|drawing a pension]] from them. Even if AL is no longer directly involved, he might still have a few contacts there. (Case is too young to be aware of this.)
>
>**Re: Dialogue Trees**
>>All of these are just ideas. I haven't necessarily committed to any of them. Also, yeah, we've written a lot, but I really haven't written much in the way of actual dialogue, let alone *alternate* dialogue. (I feel like I forget sometimes that this is supposed to be a video game and not just a fic; I'm not always writing with that idea in mind.)

>**Re: Should we try to decide on the fourth wall thing?**
>>Yes, we *should* try to decide on that :P

>>Here's my problem with it: on the one hand, MONO is supposed to be something of a tribute/homage/love letter to my favorite games, and my favorite games tend to do... that. But it's hard to shake the feeling that I might be crossing a line into outright plagiarism/that MONO will end up being too derivative. At the very least, I can see the imaginary critiques of my imaginary game deriding it as "yet another postmodern, self-aware indie game that leans too heavily on its predecessors, namely, *Undertale*, *Deltarune*, and *OneShot*". Of course, I could also imagine reviews saying, "Hey, if you love *Undertale*, *Deltarune*, and *OneShot*, you NEED to check out *MONO*", so you can see how this is a bit of a dilemma. ^fourth-wall
