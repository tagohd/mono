>issue:: Why is Case investigating James?

OOOH! Maybe he's an [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] auditor sent to investigate James (so, he's not just Wolfwood; he's also Milly[^1]). ~~IMAS caught wind that James is researching the spell [[Destroy Legendary Artifact]], and being a group of huge nerds, they aren't too happy about the possibility of priceless [[Legendary Artifacts]] being destroyed.~~ Unlike Meryl and Milly, he's undercover.

[Lun]: Oh, this doesn't work anymore with my whole idea for [[(Talk) James RedawiÄ‡]], but that hasn't been agreed upon anyway. Also, he might be investigating James for the IMAS for other reasons if we go that route (he's a powerful evil wizard man who seems to be getting increasingly unstable or something).

[Sudo]: Yeah, that could work. Oh, maybe James is defrauding IMAS out of a lot of grant money or something.

## Species
>[!bug]
>sudoMajor:: I thought I knew what species Case was, but now I'm not sure.

>[!question] [issue:: What species is Case?]
>I said he's a wolverine, but is he, though? I'm not sure if that really fits him.

I don't know why I'm not sure it fits him. Here's what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine) says about them:

>The wolverine is the largest land-dwelling species of the family Mustelidae. It is a muscular carnivore and a solitary animal. The wolverine has a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion to its size, with the documented ability to kill prey many times larger than itself.

>Wolverines are considered to be primarily scavengers. A majority of the wolverine's sustenance is derived from carrion, on which it depends almost exclusively in winter and early spring. Wolverines may find carrion themselves, feed on it after the predator (often, a pack of wolves), has finished, or simply take it from another predator. Wolverines are also known to follow wolf and lynx trails, purportedly with the intent of scavenging the remains of their kills. Whether eating live prey or carrion, the wolverine's feeding style appears voracious, leading to the nickname of "glutton" (also the basis of the scientific name). However, this feeding style is believed to be an adaptation to food scarcity, especially in winter.

Growing up food insecure could be a good backstory for him. It could also enhance the Wolfwood parallels, since Wolfwood grew up an orphan.

> L: I'll see if I can make that work with his design!

## Old Notes
>[!tldr]
>Status: Resolved
>
>Case is 18. His first appearance is actually closer to the beginning of Act I. He's more of a deuteragonist than an antagonist. He's still not a wolf.

- He shows up near the end of Act I, first as an antagonist and later as a love interest?
	- Maybe it's one-sided. However, Luke *does* have two hands...
- Nicholas D. Wolfwood. He's Nicholas D. Wolfwood. #Cite/TV/Trigun98 [tvRefType:: Trigun/Character]
	- He's not a wolf, though. That would be too obvious.
- Probably just a bit older than Luke, maybe 19

# General Discussion
## About
Sudo: Huh. The main character's name is Luke. And the secondary protagonist(?) is named Case? Luke and Case. Wonder where I came up with that. Luke and Case. Lucas. And ~~Clase~~ Claus?

Sudo: Also, Case Weston sounds a little too similar to Case Western, as in Case Western Reserve University. Well, Donald Knuth (inventor of TeX, among other accomplishments) and Gregg Gillis (Girl Talk) went there, so maybe it can stay.

## The Things He Does For Love
[Lun]: MY LOVE INTEREST!!! At least let Luke revive him after defeating AL. Oh, or what if you get to use the [[BFS 10000]] after defeating AL for a purpose of the player's choice? You could revive a love interest that died, revive James, AL(??!?), or use it for something different entirely.

[Sudo]: Oooh, that's a really good idea! You know, except for the part where it might destroy the universe.
[Sudo]: Lol, multiple endings, but most of them are just "The universe was destroyed, but you get to spend eternity with $Character"
[Sudo]: Hmmm, I had another gameplay idea earlier, but what was it?
[Sudo]: Oh, it was: after you discover that Luke is [[LukeVISION (TM)|colorblind]], the game display changes to reflect that.
[Sudo]: Funny coming up with these ideas when the game is not being made.
#Gameplay 

vnViable:: "Case heroically sacrifices himself in the final battle against AL, which includes yet another scripted game over. ([[(Talk) Case Weston#The Things He Does For Love|ref]])", "Different endings, most of which boil down to &quot;Just Monika&quot;", "The game display changes to reflect Luke's protanopia after that fact is revealed. (Maybe this only makes sense if the game is in first-person.)"
