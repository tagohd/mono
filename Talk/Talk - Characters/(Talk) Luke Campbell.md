## Luke, THE RELUCTANT HERO
His bond with [[Sam Ward|Sam]] is so strong that it allows him to track their SOUL to [[CURSED AL]]. Luke’s SOUL is also quite powerful itself, allowing him to use [[Magic]], but it’s his bond with Sam that truly gives him strength.

>[!bug]
>issue:: It hasn't been decided whether Sam actually has a [[SOUL]].

## Various Luke Characterizations
>[!tldr]
>Status: Partially Resolved
>
>Accepted:
>- Luke is a dogboy and should not eat chocolate
>- Luke wants to eat the chocolate anyway
>- Other characters may try to prevent this
>- Luke is an idiot
>- Luke can disguise the fact that he is a dogboy
>- Luke helps various other people on his quest
>- Luke saves Case's ass, and Case catches feelings for Luke
>- Case tries to stop Luke from eating the chocolate orange
>- Luke is colorblind
>
>Rejected:
>- Luke's quest is solely/primarily about obtaining chocolate (it's actually about saving Sam)
>- The Mothers Campbell encourage Luke on his quest to eat chocolate and instruct him to hide his dogness (see preceding point, but they may have taught him this for some other reason)
>- Case is working against Luke to acquire THE ORB for The Emperoress (he's actually working *with* Luke)
>
>Unclear:
>- [issue:: Does the player know Luke wants to eat the chocolate orange?]
>- [issue:: How many people are in Luke's party when they are in Rhapsody?]
>- [issue:: Why does Luke feel he has to hide the fact that he is a dogboy?]

>[!success]+ Included
>Main idea: Luke was fully aware [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|the Orb]] was made of chocolate and wanted to eat it from the start
>>[!note]
>>Luke may not know the difference between orange and red, but he knew the chocolate orange was just a chocolate orange and not THE ORB. He was just joking.
>
>- As the middle way between dogs and humans, dog people are very intolerant to chocolate, but don’t die from it (unless they eat a ton maybe). 
>- Because of this, some more reckless dog people (deople?) want to eat chocolate even more as it is the forbidden snack
>- This is a commonly known fact, and as such other species will usually do their best to prevent deople from getting access to any chocolate
>
>You know how you can broadly divide dog races into the group that got bred to do a few simple tasks (e.g. retrieving game for a hunter) who are great at listening to orders but have a DVD logo bouncing around in their heads at all times vs the ones that got bred to Handle Things on their own (e.g. herding sheep) and are the smart bois? Luke is a race of the former group and as a pureblood idiot wants nothing more than to consume the chocc
>
>- On ~~his quest to acquire chocolate~~, he learned to disguise the fact that he’s a derson (dog person) by hiding his ears and tail like this (hey look it’s the idea that led to this whole google doc!):![[tumblr_a95290422c786493948da1b76d44e38c_e848edc9_1280.png]]
>- This is nothing new for deople to do, Luke is just better at it than most because his parents helped him

>[!fail]+ Rejected
>- It may seem counterintuitive that his parents are helping him eat the semi-poisonous food. It turns out they do love him but they are simply also idiots and also went on the same quest when they were young. So now they want to help him too!

>[!bug]+
>issue:: Luke's quest is not (primarily) about obtaining chocolate. He can disguise the fact that he's a dogboy, but perhaps he learned to do so for some other reason. As far as Luke's parents are aware, he is on a quest to save Sam, but they may still have taught him how to hide his dogness.

>[!success]+ Included
>- For some reason he gets asked to help on the quest to recover the cursed orb. Somehow he also knows that it’s made of chocolate (there’s also some really good lore reason for the orb to be made of chocolate)
>>[!note]
>>Again, Luke knows THE ORB is not a chocolate orange.
>- Maybe on his quest ~~to acquire chocolate~~ he’s helping everyone he encounters who needs it (because next to an idiot he’s also a very good boy) and his skill in combat is noticed?
>-  He accepts the quest seemingly because he just wants to help get rid of the cursed object. ~~While this is partially true, he really just wants to eat it.~~

>[!question]+ Unclear
>- The fact that he wants to eat it is unknown to both the player, who only gets to see Luke’s dialogue and not his thoughts, and his party members, who are all various flavors of idiot and don’t see through Luke’s poorly disguised intentions.
>
>If the Legendary Artifact jingle plays when he picks up the orange, then it might lead the player to think that Luke is being serious. However, Case might be the only person in Luke's party at that point.

>[!success]+ Included
>- The first person to notice his true intentions is [[Case Weston|the other person trying to acquire the orb]] in [[Rhapsody]] city
>- Despite being one of the first people in the story with more than two brain cells functioning at any given time, Luke ends up saving him in Rhapsody city from something really spooky or whatever. And then he bails with the orb (but feels bad about not giving it to the other guy).
>- Regrettably for him, he gets feelings for Luke after being saved by him, therefore becoming the (main?) love interest (enemies to lovers anyone?)
>>[!note]
>>I kinda intended for Sam to be the main love interest, but Luke *does* have two hands, er... paws. Also, Case is more Luke's rival than his enemy.

>[!fail]+ Mostly Rejected
>- While he was initially trying to get the orb because he was ordered to do so by [[Other Ideas from Lunathrix|the big bad]], he gradually ends up trying to take the orb from Luke to prevent him from poisoning himself, thereby fulfilling the “What’s that in your mouth? SPIT THAT OUT!” role
>
>>[!note]
>>Case is on Luke's side the whole time, I think. They're working together to get THE ORB. But he does still try to stop Luke from eating the chocolate orange.

>[!success]+ Mostly Included
>Or maybe he just has [[LukeVISION (TM)]] and grabs the [[chocolate orange]] by mistake? But once he realizes it's not actually THE ORB, he still wants to eat it. Maybe this can be a recurring thing throughout the story, and it also ties into Luke hiding the fact that he's a dogboy. (Maybe deople (dog-people) are discriminated against for some reason?) ~~Pretty much everyone knows that deople (dog-people) are colorblind,~~ but not everyone knows that Luke is a dogboy. (And maybe Luke is so much of an idiot that he's not even aware he's colorblind.)
>
>>[!note]
>>I think only Luke is colorblind, not all deople (dog people).

## Other Notes
>[!bug]
>sudoMajor:: If Luke is a pacifist crybaby like Vash, wouldn't that make the game too similar to Undertale?
>%% [issue:: If Luke is a pacifist crybaby like Vash, wouldn't that make the game too similar to Undertale?] %%

> L: Maybe he's strongly against killing but doesn't mind incredible violence? 

- Imagine if Vash the Stampede were a short king. And a dogboy. #Cite/TV/Trigun98 [tvRefType:: Trigun/Character]
	- Goofy ~~blond~~ guy that doesn't look like he could easily fuck you up, but he can. He just chooses not to.
	- Tragic backstory?
	- Also has a tendency to be put into Situations (TM)

>[!note]
>For as much as the game is a love letter to Undertale and my other favorite games, I feel like basing the main character on Vash the Stampede (a guy who *really* doesn't want to kill anyone) might make it a bit *too* similar to Undertale.
>
>We could have him actively refuse to kill people. This would make the combat similar to Deltarune where the enemies just run away when their HP is too low. In this case, however, it's made obvious that it's Luke's choice to end the battle, not the enemies'. (He could also be like Niko OneShot and straight up tell the player when he doesn't want to do something.)
>
>Also, if he ever does kill someone (*cough cough* James), he feels really bad about it. *Really* bad. Like, physically sick. Even if they're a terrible person like James. Then he's less like a video game protagonist and more like a real person. I'm not speaking from personal experience here or anything, but I've been led to believe that killing someone has a tendency to really fuck you up in the head. #Gameplay 
^ptsd

vnViable:: Luke does NOT want to kill anyone, and he'll have a Very Bad Time (TM) if he does. ([[(Talk) Luke Campbell#^ptsd|ref]])

ideaWithDependencies:: Luke kills James with the BLADE OF POWER after AL reveals that James manipulated him.

Dependencies:: "[[BLADE OF POWER]] - Potentially affects order of acquisition", "[[2.1 Timeline]] - Needs to be added", "[[2.4 Atonement with the Father]] - Probably should go here"

# Closed Issues
## Age
>[!tldr]+
>Status: Resolved
>
>Luke is 17 and a high school junior (birthday: 22 October 2003). Sam is a couple months younger (05 December 2003). Case is 18 (15 July 2002), and has just graduated high school.
>
>There are no plans to include any sexually explicit scenes in the game. I don't want to write that.
>%%[aq:: How old are Luke, Sam, and Case?]%%

(Carried over from [[Sam Ward#Characterizations]])
* \[Sam\] is about Luke's age, so... 16-17? (I haven't really decided how old Luke is, either.)

Lun:
>Considering the significant amount of Luke-centered romance in this story, how about him being an adult? Like 20 or so?

Sudo:
>Yeah, that can work. I went with Luke being 16 based off the scrapped idea that he turns into a dogboy instead of always being one, and he's such an idiot that he thinks it's Puberty 2: Electric Boogaloo. (Although, the older he is, the funnier that would be.)

>Wait, actually I'm not sure if that can work. That breaks a lot of dependencies, so to speak. Luke and Sam being on the cross-country team doesn't really make sense, for one. Sure, they could be on the college team, but [[Genton]] doesn't have a college. I guess they just run for fun? (Well, Sam does, anyway.)
>
>And why do they both still live with their parents? I'm not sure how well everything I wrote in [[1.1 The Call to Adventure]] would work if Luke was older.

---
>Okay, let's look at it this way: Luke's out of high school. What does that affect?

>[!question]+ Luke still wants to leave Genton. Why hasn't he already left?
>Possible reasons:
>- Parents need his help on the farm
>- Can't afford to move out
>	- They own at least one horse, possibly more, and horses are expensive. Just because they live in the country doesn't mean they're poor. And we still don't know what they grow on their farm.
>	- Counterpoint: Maybe they're spending all their money on the horses
>- Doesn't think he's smart enough to go to college/college wouldn't be a good fit for him
>- Saving up money to go to college
>- College is out for the summer
>	- I like this one, actually. If he's already in college, I might not have to change that much. But then I'd have to figure out what he's studying.
>	- It would also explain why Sam is still in Genton. They're home for the summer, too.
>- Dropped out of college
>	- *Night in the Woods* reference?
>- D E P R E S S I O N
>	- *Night in the Woods* reference? (I still haven't beaten that game either.)
>- Doesn't know what he wants to do, just knows he doesn't want to stay in Genton

>[!info]+ Luke can now go to [[Genton#Boringsville at Night|the lounge]].
>The lounge kinda sucks, though. The band seemingly only knows that one song. (Don't they ever get tired of playing it?) Plus, it reeks of stale cigar smoke and cheap beer.

>[!question]+ Why does he take the horse? He's definitely old enough to drive.
>It'd be one thing if he was 16. You could say he hasn't gotten his license yet, or he doesn't have his own car.
>
>Possible reasons:
>- Can't drive
>- Car is a piece of shit
>	- Maybe he should cross off "mechanic" from his list of possible careers
>- Forgot he had a car because he's an idiot
>- Just really likes riding his horse (and [[Plata]] isn't actually that far away; definitely too far to walk, though)
>	- Environmentally friendly!

> Yeah, okay, let's say he's 19 and he's back home after his first year in college. (Or maybe it's winter break.) And I'll age everyone else (i.e. Sam and Case) up accordingly.

Lun:
>Actually, I don't mind him being younger that much on second thought. It's not like we were going to put explicit scenes in this story. Right?!

Sudo:
>Correct. 1) It's not that kind of game. 2) I wouldn't be comfortable writing that regardless of the characters' ages. I guess I'll change everyone's ages again?
