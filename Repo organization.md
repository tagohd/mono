[Lun]: In order to not clutter files with Lunsays and Sudosays, maybe we should delete eachothers' comments after reading them? Their main function is just warning eachother of new stuff anyways. 
[Sudo]: That's why I commented them out with \%\%, then you can just put it into "read" view and they disappear. You could also just delete one of the : so it no longer shows up in Dataview. But maybe they're not always worth preserving.

[Lun]: Also, what do you think is the best way for me to make clear what text was written by me? The way I'm doing it right here is kinda neat but doesn't allow for newlines or lists or anything
That breaks it, see?

[Lun]:
Something like this kinda works for longer parts if I need lists I suppose?

---

[Lun]: This is nice for shorter comments though.

# Answers
Sudosays:: I'm just going to respond to your private post here and respond to everything else inline.

[First]: How are you making everything small? Oh, like that. Okay.

I have to leave for my piano lesson right now, but I'll respond to the rest of these later.

## One
>sudoscience  
>Anyway, I’m going to continue blowing up your DMs because I’m too cheap to pay $8/mo for Obsidian Sync and too lazy to figure out how to make obsidian-git work on my phone. Sorry for being weird about my OCs in your DMs. It will happen again.

>> Don’t worry, I’ve already got the optimal solution.

Oh?

## Two
>sudoscience  
>If you have any insights into this, I’d appreciate it. I chose “origin”, and it didn’t work.

>> I’m sorry but I have no clue, I didn’t even know Obsidian had a mobile version. Kinda messed up tbh.

>sudoscience  
>I could try creating an issue, but I assume the problem is more with my unfamiliarity with git than the plugin itself. Doesn’t help that the documentation ([https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Start+here](https://href.li/?https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Start+here)) is pretty sparse

>> I’m confused, is the issue Git or Obsidian? (since you’re linking some Obsidian docs)

Don't worry, I'm confused too. I think the problem is with Git, but it might be specific to "Git in Obsidian on iOS", so I guess it's kinda both?

## Three
>sudoscience  
>This could also set up something of a “No, I am your father” moment when Luke first confronts AL. AL just wipes the floor with Luke (maybe it’s one of those scripted battles where you’re supposed to lose), and Luke says something like, “How could I have lost? I thought I was THE CHOSEN ONE.” And AL’s just like

>> But then you win anyway because of the power of friendship? Or maybe Luke decides to help AL because he’s a sucker for romantic tragedies.

I was thinking it was more like: you lose this first time, and then you come back later after you've gained more power-ups or something and then you can defeat him. I'm sure this happens in several video games, but the first example that comes to mind for me is Mega Man X. The very first stage ends with a fight against Vile that you can't win. X isn't strong enough, and Zero has to save him. (Spoilers for a 29-year-old game ahead)

```[!]-After X has defeated all of the Mavericks and is preparing to take on Sigma, he has to fight Vile again. He loses. Again. Zero saves him. Again. Except this time Zero sacrifices himself, which completely refills X's health bar (somehow), and then you fight Vile for real and defeat him. And then, with his dying "breath" (he's a robot), Zero gives X some motivational "I always knew you could do it, go on without me" kind of speech.
```

Hmmm, maybe [[Case Weston|Case]] could have a similar arc...
