[Lun]: In order to not clutter files with Lunsays and Sudosays, maybe we should delete eachothers' comments after reading them? Their main function is just warning eachother of new stuff anyways. 

[Lun]: Also, what do you think is the best way for me to make clear what text was written by me? The way I'm doing it right here is kinda neat but doesn't allow for newlines or lists or anything
That breaks it, see?

[Lun]:
Something like this kinda works for longer parts if I need lists I suppose?

[Lun]: This is nice for shorter comments though.
