[Lun]: In order to not clutter files with Lunsays and Sudosays, maybe we should delete eachothers' comments after reading them? Their main function is just warning eachother of new stuff anyways. 
[Sudo]: That's why I commented them out with \%\%, then you can just put it into "read" view and they disappear. You could also just delete one of the : so it no longer shows up in Dataview. But maybe they're not always worth preserving.

[Lun]: Also, what do you think is the best way for me to make clear what text was written by me? The way I'm doing it right here is kinda neat but doesn't allow for newlines or lists or anything
That breaks it, see?

[Lun]:
Something like this kinda works for longer parts if I need lists I suppose?

[Lun]: This is nice for shorter comments though.

Sudosays:: I'm just going to respond to your private post here and respond to everything else inline.

[First]: How are you making everything small? Oh, like that. Okay.

I have to leave for my piano lesson right now, but I'll respond to the rest of these later.
