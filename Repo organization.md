[Lun]: In order to not clutter files with Lunsays and Sudosays, maybe we should delete eachothers' comments after reading them? Their main function is just warning eachother of new stuff anyways. 
[Sudo]: That's why I commented them out with \%\%, then you can just put it into "read" view and they disappear. You could also just delete one of the : so it no longer shows up in Dataview. But maybe they're not always worth preserving.

[Lun]: Also, what do you think is the best way for me to make clear what text was written by me? The way I'm doing it right here is kinda neat but doesn't allow for newlines or lists or anything
That breaks it, see?

[Lun]:
Something like this kinda works for longer parts if I need lists I suppose?

[Lun]: This is nice for shorter comments though. %% You could just, I don't know, use actual comments?%%

I don't know about you, but I'm looking at the editing view like 99.9% of the time, so I'll probably see your comments.

Plus you can do multi-line comments. Only problem is you can't collapse them.

# Unless you use a heading
Then you can collapse the comment.

[First]: How are you making everything small? Oh, like that. Okay.

## 2.1 Obsidian Sync

>Anyway, I’m going to continue blowing up your DMs because I’m too cheap to pay $8/mo for Obsidian Sync and too lazy to figure out how to make obsidian-git work on my phone. Sorry for being weird about my OCs in your DMs. It will happen again.

Oh?

>Well, I have found a slightly less convenient workaround: uploading the files to my computer from my phone via OneDrive. But I am considering giving them that $8/mo for Obsidian Sync. They made a good app and they deserve a little walking around money

L:
>A Onedrive workaround seems truly anguish-inducing.  
>Also, jokes on me for selling you Obsidian as a “great free program” only for you to start paying for it within a week.

### Response
Yeah, so, when I first sent this, I hadn't actually paid for anything yet, but I went ahead and purchased Obsidian Sync for myself. Seems neat. Any changes I make on my phone are automatically synced to my computer and vice versa, but until I can figure out how to get obsidian-git working on my phone, I'll have to wait until I'm at home to push anything (which is basically how I've already been doing things). I was kind of hoping my settings would sync over, but no dice I guess.

But managing a big vault like this on my phone doesn't seem eminently practical, especially given that my computer has roughly 27 times more storage space (3.37 TB (see below) vs 128 GB). And a much larger screen. Two much larger screens, actually.

Btw, I forgot that the $8/mo is only if you pay for the whole year (i.e. it says $8/mo, but it's really $96/yr); otherwise, it's $10/mo. But I can get a refund within 7 days, no questions asked. (If I really just want to give them my money, they also have a "Donate" option.)

#### You didn't ask, but I'm going to tell you about my hard drives
"3.37 TB?" I pretend to hear you say. "That's weird. Why isn't it something like 3.5 TB?"

That's because it's actually *5* hard drives. I have a 512 GB M.2 drive that I use as my boot drive (C:), and then I have four other hard drives that I tell my computer to pretend are actually just one drive (D:).

I don't even remember how I managed to set that up. I feel like I've become a lot less computer-proficient since I switched back to Windows from Ubuntu. But that's how I had it set up when I was a Linux nerd. Oh, I think it was called "logical volume management", but on Windows it's just "Storage Spaces". Anyway, my storage space consists of:

- 60 GB SSD (it was all I could afford when I first built the computer in ~2011; I was still in high school)
- 300 GB HDD
- 2 TB HDD
- 500 GB SSD (I bought this one in 2019 I think? I probably paid as much for it as I did for the 60 GB one.)

For a combined total of 2.86 TB, though Windows seems to think it's only 2.59 TB. I don't know where that other 280 GB went. (Oh. It's because of binary. Of course.)

## 2.2 Obsidian Git

S:
>If you have any insights into this, I’d appreciate it. I chose “origin”, and it didn’t work.

L:
> I’m sorry but I have no clue, I didn’t even know Obsidian had a mobile version. Kinda messed up tbh.

S:
>I could try creating an issue, but I assume the problem is more with my unfamiliarity with git than the plugin itself. Doesn’t help that the documentation ([https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Start+here](https://href.li/?https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Start+here)) is pretty sparse

L:
> I’m confused, is the issue Git or Obsidian? (since you’re linking some Obsidian docs)

### Response
Don't worry, I'm confused too. I think the problem is with Git, but it might be specific to "Git in Obsidian on iOS", so I guess it's kinda both?

## 2.3 There is no Queen of England
### Quote
S:
>This could also set up something of a “No, I am your father” moment when Luke first confronts AL. AL just wipes the floor with Luke (maybe it’s one of those scripted battles where you’re supposed to lose), and Luke says something like, “How could I have lost? I thought I was THE CHOSEN ONE.” And AL’s just like

L:
> But then you win anyway because of the power of friendship? Or maybe Luke decides to help AL because he’s a sucker for romantic tragedies.

### Response
I was thinking it was more like: you lose this first time, and then you come back later after you've gained more power-ups or something and then you can defeat him. I'm sure this happens in several video games, but the first example that comes to mind for me is Mega Man X. The very first stage ends with a fight against Vile that you can't win. X isn't strong enough, and Zero has to save him. (Spoilers for a 29-year-old game ahead)

After X has defeated all of the Mavericks and is preparing to take on Sigma, he has to fight Vile again. He loses. Again. Zero saves him. Again. Except this time Zero sacrifices himself, which completely refills X's health bar (somehow), and then you fight Vile for real and defeat him. And then, with his dying "breath" (he's a robot), Zero gives X some motivational "I always knew you could do it, go on without me" kind of speech.

Hmmm, maybe [[Case Weston|Case]] could have a similar arc...

Okay, so I watched [the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4NQsVWsf08) again. (Watch how the guy recording this throws the first half; it's not like the OMORI fight where you actually have to try before the scripted defeat happens.) First, it's not explained at all how X heals. He just does it. Even Vile is confused. Second, Zero's dying words aren't nearly as motivating as I remembered:

>X, I've taken too much damage......
>Auto repair systems can't handle it...
>My power is fading fast...
>Your power is greater than I thought.
>Maybe you can destroy Sigma.

Maybe I should create a new note called "[[Works Cited]]" just as a reference.
