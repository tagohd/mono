Genton (/‘gɪntən/ *GHIN-tən*, though more accurately transcribed as /'gɪnʔən/ *GHIN-ən*) is a small farming village where nothing much ever happens. There’s a general store, a couple restaurants, a church, and not much else. The youths, the few that there are, find life there so dull that they often refer to it pejoratively as “[[Boringsville]]”. But strange things have been happening lately: the animals have been attacking, people are disappearing, and all around there’s been a sinister feeling hanging in the air.
