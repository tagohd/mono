High in the mountains, Plata is the home of a former silver mine ("Plata" being Spanish for "silver"). The mine ran dry a long time ago, but there's a small museum dedicated to it. The museum's [[James Redawić|curator]] is so knowledgeable it's almost like he was personally there 150 years ago...

## Snowy Village
![[Snowy Village.mp3]]
It looks like a quaint little village. Snow gathers atop the roofs, and children, bundled up in warm layers, run about pelting each other with snowballs while their parents sip hot drinks indoors. There’s something off here, though; something sinister beneath the surface. You aren’t sure what it is, but you find something about this village unsettling. Best not stay here too long if you don’t wish to find out.
