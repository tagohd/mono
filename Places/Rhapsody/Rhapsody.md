## Searching for Inspiration
Imagine [[Luke Campbell|you're]] from [[Genton|a small town]], and you have to go to a big, dirty city. You don't know anybody there, all the strangers seem to hate you, and you just don't feel welcome. You didn't even want to come, but the plot required it. You seek the training of the old master who lives there, or perhaps it's the only place you can find the rare MacGuffin you need; the specifics don't matter. The point is, you're lost, you hate it here, and you're pretty sure the feeling's mutual. Oh, and it's been raining the whole time.

What's the soundtrack? (Bonus points if it's from a film or video game. For context, I've been trying to write a song based on this idea for a few weeks, and I'm stuck. I could use some inspiration, but I don't even know where to look. All the video game city soundtracks I can think of are either too upbeat or not really my style.)

## A Story to Inspire Album Art
Okay, not sure how much help this will be, and I want to note that this doesn't completely line up with my initial description of the song and also it is, like all my other Song Lore (TM), almost entirely post hoc. I did not have these ideas while writing the song but came up with them just now while listening to it. Also bear in mind that this is basically a rough draft of a rough draft of an outline. With that out of the way, let's go.

The song has 5 distinct sections. Taken together, they tell a story, but not necessarily linearly.

### A - Reflection
Luke has already left the city and reflects on his experiences there. He is still processing everything.

### B - Looking Back
Safely outside the city limits, he turns around and watches as small fires break out across the city. He got what he came there for, but it was not easy. He prays he'll never have to return.

### C - Impetus
Wandering through the city streets at night in the rain searching for the [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|MacGuffin]]. Why couldn't it have been somewhere better? Why would anyone want to live in this hellhole anyway? But it's not all bad, right?

### D - RUN!
Fairly self-explanatory. Presumably, the previous owner of the MacGuffin wasn't too willing to part with it. Or maybe Luke [[Case Weston|isn't the only one after it]], and now someone's after him so they can take it for themselves. But for Luke, it represents hope of a sort, and this is represented by the brighter chords on the piano, though they are somewhat obscured by the guitar. The hope is still there, though, in the background, but there is imminent danger in the foreground.

### E - Elegy
With some more distance between him and the city, Luke has a bittersweet moment of empathy as he realizes the person(s) after him must have been in a similarly desperate situation to so badly need the MacGuffin. They were willing to kill him for it. What did *he* have to do to obtain it?
