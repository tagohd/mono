# An abandoned WIP from ~9 years ago
Not sure if I'll actually use these, but here are some maps from back when I interpreted "worldbuilding" a bit too literally. I'm not sure I have the accompanying lore anymore (it's probably _somewhere_, but I actually wrote it out by hand), but here's what I remember about them:

- I made them in 2014-15 for a D&D campaign that I was planning to DM. Unfortunately, the campaign never happened because I was too busy figuring out the **goddamn tectonic plates** (and other minutiae) of my world.
- The premise of the campaign had something to do with a race of fanatically religious bear-people. My thought process was roughly:
	- The phrase "Does the pope shit in the woods?" is funny because it's a combination of "Is the pope Catholic?" and "Does a bear shit in the woods?"
	- Logically, the counterpart to this question must be "Are bears Catholic?"
	- $\therefore$ Bear Crusaders.
	- I don't really remember anything else, but that's the definitely the most important part.

(Hmmm... I see a slight problem here, actually. If the story doesn't take place on Earth, we're going to have to change [[Bering Strait Grigori|Bering Strait Grigori's]] name, given that there is no Bering Strait. Also, he's still a bear, but I don't think he's Catholic.)

Anyway, maps:

## A Robinson Projection with Continents Labeled
![[Medari Robinson Labels.png]]
This is the world. It's called Medari. I don't remember if that means anything or if I just threw some syllables together. I think in an earlier version of the world, I named a bunch of things by Google Translating them into random languages. I also don't know how to make the image so you can click on it and make it bigger, because this image is actually 7279x3638, so it's obviously not going to fit at full resolution. I guess just open it in your normal photo viewer instead of Obsidian?

Anyway, I'm thinking maybe the story takes place on the continent of Yeria, mostly because of the climates and the existence of mountains thereupon. Perhaps [[CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN]] is on one of the other continents. Or maybe it's just on the other side of the mountains.

How big are these continents, by the way? That's a good question that I won't be answering. I assume Medari was intended to be roughly the same size as Earth, but I don't think I ever firmly stated that anywhere.

## Just the Continents + Mountains and Rivers

## KÃ¶ppen Climate Map

My sincere apologies if you're colorblind.

As alluded to in the introduction, I didn't just assign these climates randomly. I first figured out the ocean currents and the prevailing wind patterns so that they could be somewhat realistic, or at least as realistic as I, a then-19-year-old with no relevant formal training, could make it.

I'm not going to copy the key here. Have this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification) link instead.

## Medari's Ocean Currents
![[Medari Ocean Currents.png]]
Blue currents are cold. Red currents are warm.

## Prevailing Wind Patterns
![[Medari Wind Patterns.png]]
Again, my sincere apologies if you're red-green colorblind. I don't remember what the red and green bands represent. They seem to roughly correspond to the tropics and... whatever the opposite of that is. You'll notice that I did account for the Coriolis effect.
Lunsays:: They're convection cells! :D
Sudosays:: Neat!

## A Very Ugly Map Combining Climates, Wind Patterns, and Ocean Currents
![[Medari Climates.png]]
Grey arrows are wind currents. Blue and red arrows are ocean currents. The black lines are just latitude and longitude.

## Did you think I was kidding about the plate tectonics?
![[Medari Plates and Continents.png]]
Red is convergent boundaries, blue divergent, green transform, and magenta is subduction.
