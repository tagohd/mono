[[Rhapsody]] is a large city (population: 563,023). It has several high schools, of which this is one. It has an enrollment of around 2000 students.

A good school if you want to become an apprentice mage, but maybe not if you want to get into a prestigious university. In a bad part of town, and has a bit of a gang problem. Gangs are kinda like friends, though, right?

[[Case Weston|Case]] graduated from here in 2020. (Pretty sure he wasn't in a gang.)
