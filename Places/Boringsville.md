## Name Origin
### sudoscience
Imagine you're [[Luke Campbell|The Chosen One (TM)]], and you're at the very start of your hero's journey. You come from a sleepy little town where nothing ever happens, until, of course, things do happen, and you find out you're the only one who can stop it.

What's the name of the town?

I've written a song that's currently titled "Peaceful Village", but that's kind of a boring title. Plus I already have a song called "Snowy Village", but it's about a different village. However, I can't come up with anything better right now, so I'm outsourcing my imagination to y'all. Think, like, Tazmilly, Pallet Town, Tatooine, etc.

I cannot for the life of me find the post I was thinking of about naming locations but something to try might be taking a description of the town and literally whittling it down into a name. Like if the town is "A sleepy town where nothing ever happens" you could take parts of each word or the first letter and see what comes out of it? For example, s-t-w-n-e-h could be turned into stowneth, or something of the like

Or you could do something similar with the town's relation to the story, like how toriel is the tu-torial of Undertale. It could be something super simple, like the Village of Ginnings, or Ginningston (Genningston?), which is the be-ginning of the journey, or maybe a pun of some sort based on a couple of descriptive words

Hey, thanks! I was kinda leaning in that direction actually, with the play on words idea. Or maybe just call the song "Boringsville" or something, but it's like a quote from the protagonist, e.g. "I'm from \[Town Name Here], or as I like to call it: Boringsville." Then when they come back to the town later in the story and Bad Things have happened (again, like Tazmilly or Tatooine), there'll be a sad version of the song, and the title of _that_ song will be the real name of the town. That way, I can put off coming up with the name until later, and since I haven't written the sad version yet either, I can now procrastinate on two things at once.

Couple things going on here: 1) I added a new melody, and 2) I thought it would be neat if it slowly transitioned from 8-bit to "real" instruments, so I did that. (Also, as a reminder, the original version of this song is available on Bandcamp.)

So, the "lore" here is that this is the theme of the protagonist's hometown. (The protagonist's name is Luke Campbell, btw; not sure if I've mentioned that before.) This town is basically in the middle of Bumfuck, Nowhere, and there's absolutely nothing to do, hence Luke calls it "Boringsville" instead of its actual name (which I still haven't come up with). Anyway, plot happens, Luke goes on a grand adventure, yadda yadda yadda, and at some point he returns to Boringsville, but he has a new appreciation for it. Yeah, it's a sleepy little farming town, but the people make living there worthwhile (or something sappy like that).

That's kinda what I was trying to represent by having the instruments change. The broader idea here is that this is the soundtrack for an imaginary video game with a vaguely defined plot, so maybe it's a dynamic soundtrack and the instruments get replaced as you forge relationships with the other residents or rebuild the town or something. I think it makes more sense as separate tracks, but I spent longer than I should have working on this, so I'm just going to post this.
