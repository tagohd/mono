High in the mountains, Plata is the home of a former silver mine ("Plata" being Spanish for "silver"). The mine ran dry a long time ago, but there's a small [[The Old Silver Mine|museum]] dedicated to it. The museum's [[James Redawić|curator]] is so knowledgeable it's almost like he was personally there 150 years ago...

## Snowy Village

songTitle:: Snowy Village
songRemarks:: The original version of the song as posted on Tumblr.
%%
It looks like a quaint little village. Snow gathers atop the roofs, and children, bundled up in warm layers, run about pelting each other with snowballs while their parents sip hot drinks indoors. There’s something off here, though; something sinister beneath the surface. You aren’t sure what it is, but you find something about this village unsettling. Best not stay here too long if you don’t wish to find out.

### Snowy Pt. 1 (Remake)

songTitle:: Snowy Pt. 1 (Remake)
songRemarks:: A remake of the version on *A Losing Proposition*. I always meant for it to be slightly dissonant, but this time I made it dissonant in a good way. (I used the Locrian mode instead of just random notes.)
