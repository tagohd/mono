alias: IMAS Plata Office
---
A regional office of [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]], founded by [[James RedawiÄ‡]] and [[CURSED AL]] in 1910. This is the first IMAS building, though they are now headquartered in [[Rhapsody]].

Probably looks something like this:

(Get it? Because AL and James are elks?)
