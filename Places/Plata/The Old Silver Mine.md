I'm not very good at getting the melody out of my head and onto the staff, but this is close to what I've had in mind; it's not quite right, though. Also, as you can see, it's only 16 seconds long. I'm not sure if this will play here or at [[Campbell Farms|Luke's farm]]. Maybe both? I want to say it reminds me of *West of Loathing*. #Cite/Game/West-of-Loathing [gameRefType:: West of Loathing/Music]
