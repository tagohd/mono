An abandoned silver mine in [[Plata]], and the namesake of the town (*plata* is Spanish for "silver"). It has been converted into a museum, which is operated by [[James Redawić|James]] and [[Grigori Karstov|Grigori]].

I'm not very good at getting the melody out of my head and onto the staff, but this is close to what I've had in mind; it's not quite right, though. Also, as you can see, it's only 16 seconds long. I'm not sure if this will play here or at [[Campbell Farms|Luke's farm]]. Maybe both? I want to say it reminds me of *West of Loathing*. #Cite/Game/West-of-Loathing [gameRefType:: West of Loathing/Music]

There was another, much more obvious reference that I thought of yesterday (2023-06-12), but now I can't remember what it was. #Cite/Unknown [uRefType:: Music]

# Who Works Here?
Depending on how big the museum is exactly, some of these might be the same person, or there might even be more people.
