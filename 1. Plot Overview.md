Just want to recap the plot so far since most of the recent notes have been more background information.

# Before the Story
## Before the 19th Century
Several of the [[Legendary Artifacts]] are created.

## 19th Century
[[CURSED AL]] is an evil wizard who figured out how to cast [[Longevity (Spell)]]. He meets a young wizard named [[James Redawić|James]] who wants to become his acolyte and eventually learn to cast Longevity himself. They fall in love and do lots of evil shit together, but like, romantically. They're like Bonnie and Clyde. Also, they operate a [[The Old Silver Mine|silver mine]] in [[Plata]].

>[!note]
>If [[CURSED AL]] is the one who invented the spell, maybe it should involve his [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|ORB]] instead of some rando's [[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH|CHALICE]].

##  20th Century
[[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] is founded. James and AL contribute a lot to their research but are shunted out of the spotlight when IMAS realizes how fucked up a spell Longevity is. Officially, they are still considered members in good standing (only a select few members are aware of this), but IMAS redacts their names from a lot of their projects and basically acts like they've never heard of them when anyone asks.

Somewhere along the way, they convert the mine into a museum.

At some point, AL learned James is fated to be killed sometime in the 21st Century (he doesn't know exactly when or by whom). Maybe he even learned this in the 19th Century, but now it's getting closer. Perhaps [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]] was involved in this (like a crystal ball)?

AL works tirelessly to find a way to prevent this. Somewhere in 1995-1997, with the turn of the century fast approaching, AL realizes he is still a long way away from finding a solution. He decides he must go into a kind of stasis so that he can work on this indefinitely without it ever becoming too late. Maybe doing this ends up crippling James somehow (the "stasis" spell requires a fuckton of [[mana]] and some of it hit James—being exposed to free mana when you're not prepared to channel it into a spell can have unpredictable effects); because the paralysis was caused magically, the enhanced healing granted by Longevity doesn't help. With AL gone, the now paralyzed James needs *someone* to help him, so he recruits one of the employees from the museum, [[Bering Strait Grigori|Grigori]].

## 21st Century
Years go by and James grows to resent AL more and more. Meanwhile, he becomes ever closer to Grigori. Also, he's been scamming the *shit* out of IMAS (he needed a lot of money to make his house wheelchair accessible), and they're none the wiser.

[[Case Weston|Case]], [[Luke Campbell|Luke]], and [[Sam Ward|Sam]] are born (in that order). Luke and Sam are best friends and neighbors. Luke has a huge crush on Sam, and he even joins the cross-country team to spend more time with them despite hating running (he loves walks, though, since he's a dog). Sam comes by every morning to wake up Luke to go for a run.

### 2019
AL exits stasis only to find that he was not actually in stasis; time continued to pass in a linear fashion while he was away. Fortunately, James is still alive. AL rushes to tell him that he's found a solution, but it will require more mana than even powerful wizards such as themselves could hope to handle. He will have to construct a [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]], which is similar to a philosopher's stone.

### 2020
Case graduates from Plata High School and takes an apprenticeship at IMAS. Luke and Sam are entering their junior year at Genton High School. IMAS finally starts to realize that James has been conning them and sends Case to investigate. (All of these wizards are kinda dicks, huh?)
