Just want to recap the plot so far since most of the recent notes have been more background information.

# Before the Story
## Prior to the 19th Century
Several of the [[Legendary Artifacts]] are created.

## 19th Century
[[CURSED AL]] is an evil wizard who figured out how to cast [[Longevity (Spell)|Longevity]]. He meets a young wizard named [[James Redawić|James]] who wants to become his acolyte and eventually learn to cast Longevity himself. They fall in love and do lots of evil shit together, but like, romantically. They're like Bonnie and Clyde. Also, they operate a [[The Old Silver Mine|silver mine]] in [[Plata]].

>[!note]
>If [[CURSED AL]] is the one who invented the spell, maybe it should involve his [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|ORB]] instead of some rando's [[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH|CHALICE]].

##  20th Century
[[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] is founded. James and AL contribute a lot to their research but are shunted out of the spotlight when IMAS realizes how fucked up a spell Longevity is. Officially, they are still considered members in good standing (only a select few members are aware of this), but IMAS redacts their names from a lot of their projects and basically acts like they've never heard of them when anyone asks. ^i-hope-you-remember-this-because-it-was-right-here

Somewhere along the way, they convert the mine into a museum.

At some point, AL learned James is fated to be killed sometime in the 21st Century (he doesn't know exactly when or by whom). Maybe he even learned this in the 19th Century, but now it's getting closer. Perhaps [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]] was involved in this (like a crystal ball)?

[Lun]: Oooh, what if [[Longevity (Spell)]] sets a sort of "death countdown" when casting it, and when it runs out (i.e. the magic used in the casting runs out), you die / brutally implode. Normally this is a _very long_ countdown, but something went wrong while casting Longevity on James and he got a much shorter duration (still a few centuries, but not the usual millennia). Also gives AL another reason to be so obsessed with saving James: he essentially caused his impending doom by messing up the spell.

[Sudo]: Maybe I should make them a couple hundred years older, huh? Also, I like this idea, but it seems to conflict with Luke being the one to kill James. (I have been kind of rethinking that, though. James is useful to keep around because who else is going to teach Luke new spells? At the very least, Luke probably kills him later than I initially intended, in which case he's not like Toriel.) ^3d7c01

[Lun]: Alright hear me out on this one. What if [[James Redawić|James]] gets killed in the first loop, which causes AL to successfully collect all parts of the [[BFS 10000|SOUL AMPLIFIER]], get in a big final fight with [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] and then get RESET on by [[Sam Ward|Sam]]. In the next loop however, Luke does _not_ kill James (not sure how this comes to be, maybe his sense of "something is wrong" makes him act more carefully?). This allows Luke to learn more advanced magic in the next loop and also changes the final boss fight to James, as he kills AL and takes the [[BFS 10000|SOUL AMPLIFIER]] if he survives.

[Sudo]: Hmmm... very, very interesting. I like it.

[Lun]: :D

AL works tirelessly to find a way to prevent this. Somewhere in 1995-1997, with the turn of the century fast approaching, AL realizes he is still a long way away from finding a solution. He decides he must go into a kind of stasis so that he can work on this indefinitely without it ever becoming too late. Maybe doing this ends up crippling James somehow (the "stasis" spell requires a fuckton of [[mana]] and some of it hit James—being exposed to free mana when you're not prepared to channel it into a spell can have unpredictable effects); because the paralysis was caused magically, the enhanced healing granted by Longevity doesn't help. With AL gone, the now paralyzed James needs *someone* to help him, so he recruits one of the employees from the museum, [[Bering Strait Grigori|Grigori]].

## 21st Century
Years go by and James grows to resent AL more and more. Meanwhile, he becomes ever closer to Grigori. Also, he's been scamming the *shit* out of IMAS (he needed a lot of money to make his house wheelchair accessible), and they're none the wiser.

[Lun]: Yes boy scam those fools!

[[Case Weston|Case]], [[Luke Campbell|Luke]], and [[Sam Ward|Sam]] are born (in that order). Luke and Sam are best friends and neighbors. Luke has a huge crush on Sam, and he even joins the cross-country team to spend more time with them despite hating running (he loves walks, though, since he's a dog). Sam comes by every morning to wake up Luke to go for a run.

[Lun]: Hating running is very out of character for a dogboy. This is good, because I don't want all characters to blindly take over the traits of their animal species. Get some differences in there.

[Sudo]: There's a reason for this. There wasn't when I wrote that, but there is now: Luke has mild hip dysplasia. He doesn't know it, though. Running is just supposed to be kinda painful, right? (See: [[1.1 The Call to Adventure#^5d7e02]])

[Lun]: So in game you travel at a brisk walking pace and when you dash around the screen too much you start taking DoT? :V

[Sudo]: DoT? Oh, damage over time. Maybe? It's non-fatal damage, though, so I'm not sure how you would represent that in-game. Maybe your overall move speed is reduced for a bit if you dash too much (Luke is sore), or you become more likely to miss (Luke's couldn't focus on aiming because he's in pain). I don't think it would directly impact your HP, though.

[Lun]: Me: If I make a game I want it to be with a lot of mobility and dashing! Sudo: The protagonist has the hips of a grandma. He _will_ die if you dash over twice in a row. (\* only slightly exaggerated)

sudo:: Only slightly

### 2019
AL exits stasis only to find that he was not actually in stasis; time continued to pass in a linear fashion while he was away. Fortunately, James is still alive. AL rushes to tell him that he's found a solution, but it will require more mana than even powerful wizards such as themselves could hope to handle. He will have to construct a [[BFS 10000]], which is similar to a philosopher's stone. James tells AL to pound sand. He's had a lot of time to evaluate their relationship over the past 22-24 years. In fact, James has divorced AL in absentia. AL is hurt but not discouraged—once James sees the awesome power of the [[BFS 10000]], he'll change his mind.

[Lun]: Their first encounter post-stasis seems like a difficult scene to write. Why does James not kill him on sight? We've established he pretty much hates him that amount. Is he too weak to even try? Or is he more a cold and calculating kinda guy?

[Sudo]: I will have to think about this some more. Maybe Grigori tempered him out a little. Or maybe AL was aware that James might be *just a little bit upset* and had the foresight to confront him in public. James isn't stupid enough to kill a man in broad daylight. (Alternatively, that wasn't the only thing AL was working on, and James does, in fact, try to kill him in broad daylight, but it doesn't work.)

[Lun]: I feel like confronting your hubby/ex(?) about a VERY emotional subject in public would not be a good idea if you want to get back with them. Then again, AL may not be the most emotionally intelligent person.

[Sudo]: "AL: Heyyyy, bestie! I know it's been 20+ years since I last saw you, but I think I figured out how to save your life!"
[Sudo]: "James: GTFO"

[Lun]: Yeah, this is gonna be a difficult scene to write :v

sudo:: I found a solution: [[2. Plot Overview (Again)#^not-writing-it|not writing it]]!
#reply [R:: 3]

### 2020
Case graduates from Plata High School and takes an apprenticeship at IMAS. Luke and Sam are entering their junior year at [[Genton]] High School. IMAS finally starts to realize that James has been conning them and sends Case to investigate. (All of these wizards are kinda dicks, huh?) Case goes undercover, taking a job at the museum.

Aware that IMAS is on to him, James realizes that building the [[BFS 10000]] could be the perfect opportunity. He hasn't been conning them! He's just been working on this magnum opus. James already knows how to construct a [[BFS 10000]] in principle—any necromancer worth their salt is familiar with the concept—but no one has ever managed to successfully do so. Being wheelchair-bound, he's in no condition to gather all the necessary Legendary Artifacts. And he can't ask Grigori to do it, either. Then who would take care of him?

A key component of the [[BFS 10000]] is a person without a [[SOUL]], and there just so happens to be such a person nearby: Sam. [[CURSED AL]] kidnaps them and takes them to [[CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN|his lair]].

[Lun]: Hold on, so James thinks of constructing the BFS 10000 independently of it being AL's grand plan to save James? Or he finds out about AL wanting to make one and acts like it's his idea? Also, why would the IMAS fund that, it relies on sacrificing a bunch of people as part of the construction?!

[Sudo]: There's a simple explanation for this seeming contradiction: it was 4am when I wrote it. Maybe James lies and claims to have found a way to make one without killing a bunch of people?

[Lun]: Lies are always a possible solution. I'd imagine James wouldn't want AL to know he's also after the [[BFS 10000]] though, that might tick him off right? Or will he try to sell that as "helping" to AL?

[Sudo]: Another long one

>Yeah, maybe we won't go with that idea. Maybe we go off my initial idea that James wants to destroy the Artifacts, except he's lying and actually building his own [[BFS 10000]]? Luke never actually sees the Artifacts get destroyed, but he believes James anyway.
>
>Oh! Here's an idea: Case works for IMAS, right? What if he's like, "If I bring these Artifacts to IMAS, I will get a good grade in intern, something that is both normal to want and possible to achieve"? Except bringing them to IMAS inadvertently makes it really easy for AL to find them. So, whenever you get an Artifact, you have a choice:
>	1. Give them to James, who does *something* with them (unless he's dead)
>	2. Give them to Case, who turns them into IMAS for a small amount of money (you get brownie points with Case, but James doesn't like this)
>		1. Could also be an alternative way of learning spells if James is dead (See: [[1. Plot Overview#^3d7c01]])
>	3. [[(6) June 2023 Chat Logs#^sell-the-artifacts|Sell them for a LOT of money]] (this negatively affects your relationships with both Case and James[^James])
>	4. Keep them for yourself (they're Cursed Artifacts, so this probably isn't a great idea; this also negatively affects your relationships with Case and James)
>	5. ~~Speedrun strat: Give them to CURSED AL directly~~
>
>Possible effects of keeping the Legendary Artifacts
>	- Maybe the [[BLADE OF POWER]] gives you +10 ATK but reduces your max HP, the [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM]] increases your Mana but lowers your DEF, the [[BEE]] attacks anyone around (including you), etc.
>	- Random attacks from AL's henchmen become more common
>	- Other random Bad Things (TM) become more likely
>		- OneShot-esque glitch effects?
>	- Unlocks Evil dialogue options, but negatively affects your relationships with *everyone* (similar to having negative Karma in Fallout)
>		- The effect goes both ways. Luke becomes paranoid, and other people start to think he gives off bad vibes. This is in addition to hurting your relationships with Case and James by not doing what they want.
>	- Luke just does NOT want to keep them. (If we decide to go "Fuck the fourth wall", making him keep them anyway negatively affects his relationship with *you*. Hopefully, this also makes the player feel bad.)
>		- At the very least, it becomes obvious that Luke is not having a good time. Similar to being homesick in Earthbound where you waste turns not attacking because Ness is too busy thinking about Steak or something.
>		- As it progresses, maybe Luke just outright refuses to obey your commands. You clearly don't have his best interests at heart, so why should he listen to you? This could be a way to force the player into choosing one of the other options.

[^James]: Not that you can date James, but maybe this limits the spells he teaches you?

L:
>_Reasonably_ long indeed. I do like the idea of having options of what to do with the artefacts and having a karma-meter thing, similar to the Fable games (another reference?!). This will make writing the story a bit more difficult (especially for how AL gets them from IMAS), but might be worth it. The karma thing will also involve writing a lot of alternate dialogue but hey we've been writing quite a lot already anyway. Also, should we try to decide on the fourth wall thing? Does it have a canon explanation like in OneShot?

sudo:: Never played Fable, actually, so that reference is unintentional. I'll reply more in-depth later. (continues...)

> Okay, it is later.
> 
>Re: How does AL acquire the Artifacts from IMAS?
>>Remember when I said that maybe AL and James used to be prominent members of IMAS? I said it [[1. Plot Overview#^i-hope-you-remember-this-because-it-was-right-here|here]] and [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences#^i-also-mentioned-it-here|here]] in case you forgot. Well, my new idea isn't that they were merely once well-respected members, but they literally fucking [[2. Plot Overview (Again)#^the-founders|founded it]]. They still get kicked out, though. And for as much as IMAS would like you to believe that they've changed their ways and have nothing to do with evil wizards like AL and James (perhaps even going so far as to try and retcon their history to say they were founded by an anonymous group of wizards), AL still holds a fair amount of sway with them, and James may or may not be [[2. Plot Overview (Again)#^pension|drawing a pension]] from them. Even if AL is no longer directly involved, he might still have a few contacts there. (Case is too young to be aware of this.)
>
>Re: Dialogue Trees
>>All of these are just ideas. I haven't necessarily committed to any of them. Also, yeah, we've written a lot, but I really haven't written much in the way of actual dialogue, let alone *alternate* dialogue. (I feel like I forget sometimes that this is supposed to be a video game and not just a fic; I'm not always writing with that idea in mind.)
>
>Re: Should we try to decide on the fourth wall thing?
>>Yes, we *should* try to decide on that :P
>>
>>Here's my problem with it: on the one hand, MONO is supposed to be something of a tribute/homage to my favorite games, and my favorite games tend to do... that. But it's hard to shake the feeling that I might be crossing a line into outright plagiarism. At the very least, I can see the imaginary critiques of my imaginary game deriding it as "yet another postmodern, self-aware game"

# The Story
Luke begins to worry when Sam misses their morning run. He goes to Plata and meets James. James dismisses him at first, but once he learns that Luke is looking for Sam and CURSED AL, he realizes this is the perfect opportunity. (James is also aware that Sam has no SOUL; maybe they've crossed paths, even if they haven't interacted, and James picked up on it.) Luke is young and reasonably fit. Luke is naïve and not terribly bright. But most importantly, Luke is desperate.

James easily convinces Luke that he is THE CHOSEN ONE, the only one whose SOUL is capable of defeating CURSED AL. Luke starts to get cold feet, but [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|The Dragon]] frightens his [[Luke's Noble Steed|horse]] and it breaks a leg trying to flee, leaving Luke stranded in Plata[^stranded]. James tells Luke about the [[BFS 10000]], and Case overhears. James teaches Luke a few spells ([[Mending]], [[Cure Wounds]], and [[Magic Missile]]), and then sends Luke on his way to [[Rhapsody]] to retrieve the first of seven Artifacts: [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]]. Case reveals that he is an IMAS member (though not that he is an employee), and volunteers to go with Luke to keep him safe. Having suspected that Case was there to investigate him, James is more than happy to let him go.

The two make it to Rhapsody, though they don't get along very well at first. Luke is an idiot, and Case is convinced Luke will get them both killed. Having grown up in Plata not far from the IMAS regional office, Case is also much more confident in his magical abilities, so he's a bit of a rival to Luke. They eventually retrieve THE ORB, but only narrowly escape. Luke actually ends up saving Case instead of the other way around, and they begin to bond.

[^stranded]: Lol, what if there's actually a train or something connecting Plata and Genton? Luke didn't need to take Pauline at all, and he's not actually stranded. (Or maybe he just can't afford the fare?)
