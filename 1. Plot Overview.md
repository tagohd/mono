Just want to recap the plot so far since most of the recent notes have been more background information.

# Before the Story
## Prior to the 19th Century
Several of the [[Legendary Artifacts]] are created.

## 19th Century
[[CURSED AL]] is an evil wizard who figured out how to cast [[Longevity (Spell)]]. He meets a young wizard named [[James Redawić|James]] who wants to become his acolyte and eventually learn to cast Longevity himself. They fall in love and do lots of evil shit together, but like, romantically. They're like Bonnie and Clyde. Also, they operate a [[The Old Silver Mine|silver mine]] in [[Plata]].

>[!note]
>If [[CURSED AL]] is the one who invented the spell, maybe it should involve his [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|ORB]] instead of some rando's [[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH|CHALICE]].

##  20th Century
[[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] is founded. James and AL contribute a lot to their research but are shunted out of the spotlight when IMAS realizes how fucked up a spell Longevity is. Officially, they are still considered members in good standing (only a select few members are aware of this), but IMAS redacts their names from a lot of their projects and basically acts like they've never heard of them when anyone asks.

Somewhere along the way, they convert the mine into a museum.

At some point, AL learned James is fated to be killed sometime in the 21st Century (he doesn't know exactly when or by whom). Maybe he even learned this in the 19th Century, but now it's getting closer. Perhaps [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]] was involved in this (like a crystal ball)?

[Lun]: Oooh, what if [[Longevity (Spell)]] sets a sort of "death countdown" when casting it, and when it runs out (i.e. the magic used in the casting runs out), you die / brutally implode. Normally this is a _very long_ countdown, but something went wrong while casting Longevity on James and he got a much shorter duration (still a few centuries, but not the usual millennia). Also gives AL another reason to be so obsessed with saving James: he essentially caused his impending doom by messing up the spell.

sudo:: Maybe I should make them a couple hundred years older, huh? Also, I like this idea, but it seems to conflict with Luke being the one to kill James. (I have been kind of rethinking that, though. James is useful to keep around because who else is going to teach Luke new spells? At the very least, Luke probably kills him later than I initially intended, in which case he's not like Toriel.)

AL works tirelessly to find a way to prevent this. Somewhere in 1995-1997, with the turn of the century fast approaching, AL realizes he is still a long way away from finding a solution. He decides he must go into a kind of stasis so that he can work on this indefinitely without it ever becoming too late. Maybe doing this ends up crippling James somehow (the "stasis" spell requires a fuckton of [[mana]] and some of it hit James—being exposed to free mana when you're not prepared to channel it into a spell can have unpredictable effects); because the paralysis was caused magically, the enhanced healing granted by Longevity doesn't help. With AL gone, the now paralyzed James needs *someone* to help him, so he recruits one of the employees from the museum, [[Bering Strait Grigori|Grigori]].

## 21st Century
Years go by and James grows to resent AL more and more. Meanwhile, he becomes ever closer to Grigori. Also, he's been scamming the *shit* out of IMAS (he needed a lot of money to make his house wheelchair accessible), and they're none the wiser.

[Lun]: Yes boy scam those fools!

[[Case Weston|Case]], [[Luke Campbell|Luke]], and [[Sam Ward|Sam]] are born (in that order). Luke and Sam are best friends and neighbors. Luke has a huge crush on Sam, and he even joins the cross-country team to spend more time with them despite hating running (he loves walks, though, since he's a dog). Sam comes by every morning to wake up Luke to go for a run.

[Lun]: Hating running is very out of character for a dogboy. This is good, because I don't want all characters to blindly take over the traits of their animal species. Get some differences in there.

sudo:: There's a reason for this. There wasn't when I wrote that, but there is now: Luke has mild hip dysplasia. He doesn't know it, though. Running is just supposed to be kinda painful, right? (See: [[1.1 The Call to Adventure#^5d7e02]])

### 2019
AL exits stasis only to find that he was not actually in stasis; time continued to pass in a linear fashion while he was away. Fortunately, James is still alive. AL rushes to tell him that he's found a solution, but it will require more mana than even powerful wizards such as themselves could hope to handle. He will have to construct a [[BFS 10000]], which is similar to a philosopher's stone. James tells AL to pound sand. He's had a lot of time to evaluate their relationship over the past 22-24 years. In fact, James has divorced AL in absentia. AL is hurt but not discouraged—once James sees the awesome power of the [[BFS 10000]], he'll change his mind.

[Lun]: Their first encounter post-stasis seems like a difficult scene to write. Why does James not kill him on sight? We've established he pretty much hates him that amount. Is he too weak to even try? Or is he more a cold and calculating kinda guy?

sudo:: I will have to think about this some more. Maybe Grigori tempered him out a little. Or maybe AL was aware that James might be *just a little bit upset* and had the foresight to confront him in public. James isn't stupid enough to kill a man in broad daylight. (Alternatively, that wasn't the only thing AL was working on, and James does, in fact, try to kill him in broad daylight, but it doesn't work.)

### 2020
Case graduates from Plata High School and takes an apprenticeship at IMAS. Luke and Sam are entering their junior year at [[Genton]] High School. IMAS finally starts to realize that James has been conning them and sends Case to investigate. (All of these wizards are kinda dicks, huh?) Case goes undercover, taking a job at the museum.

Aware that IMAS is on to him, James realizes that building the [[BFS 10000]] could be the perfect opportunity. He hasn't been conning them! He's just been working on this magnum opus. James already knows how to construct a [[BFS 10000]] in principle—any necromancer worth their salt is familiar with the concept—but no one has ever managed to successfully do so. Being wheelchair-bound, he's in no condition to gather all the necessary Legendary Artifacts. And he can't ask Grigori to do it, either. Then who would take care of him?

[Lun]: Hold on, so James thinks of constructing the BFS 10000 independently of it being AL's grand plan to save James? Or he finds out about AL wanting to make one and acts like it's his idea? Also, why would the IMAS fund that, it relies on sacrificing a bunch of people as part of the construction?!

sudo:: There's a simple explanation for this seeming contradiction: it was 4am when I wrote it. Maybe James lies and claims to have found a way to make one without killing a bunch of people?
#reply [R:: 8]

A key component of the [[BFS 10000]] is a person without a [[SOUL]], and there just so happens to be such a person nearby: Sam. [[CURSED AL]] kidnaps them and takes them to [[CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN|his lair]].

# The Story
Luke begins to worry when Sam misses their morning run. He goes to Plata and meets James. James dismisses him at first, but once he learns that Luke is looking for Sam and CURSED AL, he realizes this is the perfect opportunity. (James is also aware that Sam has no SOUL; maybe they've crossed paths, even if they haven't interacted, and James picked up on it.) Luke is young and reasonably fit. Luke is naïve and not terribly bright. But most importantly, Luke is desperate.

James easily convinces Luke that he is THE CHOSEN ONE, the only one whose SOUL is capable of defeating CURSED AL. Luke starts to get cold feet, but [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|The Dragon]] frightens his [[Luke's Noble Steed|horse]] and it breaks a leg trying to flee, leaving Luke stranded in Plata[^stranded]. James tells Luke about the [[BFS 10000]], and Case overhears. James teaches Luke a few spells ([[Mending]], [[Cure Wounds]], and [[Magic Missile]]), and then sends Luke on his way to [[Rhapsody]] to retrieve the first of seven Artifacts: [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]]. Case reveals that he is an IMAS member (though not that he is an employee), and volunteers to go with Luke to keep him safe. Having suspected that Case was there to investigate him, James is more than happy to let him go.

The two make it to Rhapsody, though they don't get along very well at first. Luke is an idiot, and Case is convinced Luke will get them both killed. Having grown up in Plata not far from the IMAS regional office, Case is also much more confident in his magical abilities, so he's a bit of a rival to Luke. They eventually retrieve THE ORB, but only narrowly escape. Luke actually ends up saving Case instead of the other way around, and they begin to bond.

[^stranded]: [sudoMinor:: Lol, what if there's actually a train or something connecting Plata and Genton? Luke didn't need to take Pauline at all, and he's not actually stranded. (Or maybe he just can't afford the fare?)]
