[[Luke Campbell|Luke’s]] commitment to his quest is challenged. On second thought, maybe this wasn’t such a good idea. He emerges victorious from his first major battle, and his resolve is stronger than ever. Within the game, this will later be recontextualized as not that big of a challenge.

Perhaps [[James Redawić|James]] challenges Luke to a test of strength, and Luke accidentally kills him. Despite this, James tells him with his dying breath that he is proud of Luke, and he knows Luke will ultimately be victorious. James knew Luke would kill him, as it had been foretold, but he dies before telling Luke he is doomed to a similar fate.
