%%I would like for this to not be self-referential, but whatever. (Why can't this be more like LaTeX?)%%

# 2 Focus
Files that need urgent attention (this is mostly just for quick access)
```dataview
TABLE FocusComment as "What Needs Work"
WHERE focus
```

# 3 Changes
## 3.1 Sudo's Changes
### 3.1.1 Chromatic Changes (New Songs)
```dataview
TABLE songTitleNew as "Title", songRemarksNew as "Remarks"
FROM #chromaticChange AND #unheardByLun
SORT file.mtime DESC
```

### 3.1.2 Sudo's Changes
I have combined the major and minor changes into one query, sorted by priority as follows:

| Priority | Change Type                               |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1-10     | Major Change (urgent)                     |
| 11-20    | Major Change (urgent) & Minor Changes     |
| 30       | Major Change (non-urgent) & Minor Changes |
| 40       | Major Change (non-urgent)                 |
| 99       | Minor Change                              |

```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", sudoChange as "Sudo's Changes", Priority, Sudosays, Lunsays
FROM #sudoChange and #unseenByLun
SORT Priority, file.mtime DESC
```

### 3.1.3 Replies
You can click on the "ref" link, and it should take you directly to the comment I replied to. (Useful for longer articles.)

```dataview
TABLE R AS "Number", sudo AS "Reply"
FROM #reply 
SORT min(R)
```
%%
It would be cool if the number linked directly to the block where the reply is, but I can't figure out how to do this.

## 3.2 Lun's changes

```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", lunR as "Change number", Lunsays, Sudosays
FROM #lun
SORT min(lunR), file.mtime DESC
```

# 4 Files with Music
```dataview
TABLE songTitle as "Title", songRemarks as "Remarks"
FROM #contains-music 
```

# 5 Unanswered Questions
```dataview
TABLE question as "Question(s)"
FROM #unanswered-questions
SORT file.name
```

## 5.1 Unresolved Issues
```dataview
TABLE issue AS "ISSUE" FROM #issues 
```

# 6 Answered Questions

```dataview
TABLE aq AS "Question(s)"
FROM #answered-questions 
```

# 7 Ideas with Dependencies
For when I have an idea that I'm not ready to implement just yet, but if/when it is implemented, I'll have to update multiple files to reflect it.

```dataview
TABLE ideaWithDependencies AS "Idea", Dependencies
FROM #Ideas WHERE ideaWithDependencies
```

# 8 Stubs
```dataview
LIST FROM #stub 
```
# 9 All
```dataview
TABLE file.mday AS "Last changed", Lunsays, Sudosays
SORT file.mtime DESC
```
