%%I would like for this to not be self-referential, but whatever. (Why can't this be more like LaTeX?)%%

# 2 Focus
Files that need urgent attention (this is mostly just for quick access)
```dataview
TABLE FocusComment as "What Needs Work", Sudosays, Lunsays
WHERE focus
```

# 3 Changes
## 3.1 Sudo's Changes
### 3.1.1 Chromatic Changes (New Songs)
```dataview
TABLE songTitle as "Title", songRemarks as "Remarks"
FROM #chromaticChange AND #unheardByLun
```

### 3.1.2 Replies
I'm going to do it kinda the same way you are. If it doesn't really change anything, I'll put it here. Maybe I'll eventually consolidate the major and minor changes, too. And I'm deleting the Trivial Changes section because, by definition, they aren't important.
```dataview
TABLE R AS "Number", sudo AS "Reply"
FROM #reply 
SORT min(R)
```
%%
It would be cool if the number linked directly to the block where the reply is, but I can't figure out how to do this.

### 3.1.3 Changes Lun Should Really Look At (Major Changes)
>[!question] What's a major change?
>To me, it's more to do with how much I think you need to see it than how much actually changed. They're frequently *big* changes, or they involve questions I'd like you to answer. Or maybe there's just a new song :)
>
>To paraphrase Potter Stewart, "You'll know one when you see one."
```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", sudoMajor as "Sudo's Changes", Priority, Sudosays, Lunsays
FROM #majorChange and #unseenByLun
SORT !(Priority), Priority, file.mtime DESC
```

### 3.1.4 Changes Lun Should Probably Look At (Minor Changes)
>[!question] What's a minor change?
>This is also subjective, but I think it does have more to do with "amount changed" than Major Changes do. Examples: Specified how old a character is, created a new (stub) note, added information to a note that was already present in another note. They're *kinda* important, but if it can be easily summarized here in the overview, it's probably a minor change. Also how big of an impact it has on other notes.

>[!tip]
>If you feel the need to add a priority to it, it's probably a major change. But feel free to do it anyway. Note that you can only assign one priority per note.

```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", sudoMinor as "Sudo's Changes", Priority, Sudosays, Lunsays
FROM #minorChange and #unseenByLun 
SORT !Priority, Priority, file.mtime DESC
```

## 3.2 Lun's changes

L: I don't write all that much anyway, so I streamlined my procedure for responding a bit to save some time. Just delete the "#lun" and "lunR::x" lines when you've read the thing and this should work pretty well I think?
I also sorted them in order that I wrote them ("Change number") so you can more easily follow my train of thought.
```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", lunR as "Change number", Lunsays, Sudosays
FROM #lun
SORT min(lunR), file.mtime DESC
```

# 4 Files with Music
```dataview
TABLE songTitle as "Title", songRemarks as "Remarks"
FROM #contains-music 
```

# 5 Unanswered Questions
```dataview
TABLE question as "Question(s)"
FROM #unanswered-questions
SORT file.name
```

# 6 Answered Questions
```dataview
TABLE aq AS "Question(s)"
FROM #answered-questions 
```

# 7 Stubs
```dataview
LIST FROM #stub 
```
# 8 All
```dataview
TABLE file.mday AS "Last changed", Lunsays, Sudosays
SORT file.mtime DESC
```
