%%I would like for this to not be self-referential, but whatever. (Why can't this be more like LaTeX?)%%

# 2 Focus
Files that need urgent attention (this is mostly just for quick access)
```dataview
TABLE focusComment as "What Needs Work", Sudosays, Lunsays
WHERE focus
```

# 3 Changes
## 3.1 Changes Lun Should Really Look At (Major Changes)
### 3.1.1 Get these things out of my way
>[!question] What's a major change?
>To me, it's more to do with how much I think you need to see it than how much actually changed. They're frequently *big* changes, or they involve questions I'd like you to answer. Or maybe there's just a new song :)
>
>To paraphrase Potter Stewart, "You'll know one when you see one."
### 3.1.2 Table
```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", sudoMajor as "Sudo's Changes", Priority, Sudosays, Lunsays
FROM #majorChange and #unseenByLun
SORT !(Priority), Priority, file.mtime DESC
```

## 3.2 Changes Lun Should Probably Look At (Minor Changes)
>[!question] What's a minor change?
>This is also subjective, but I think it does have more to do with "amount changed" than Major Changes do. Examples: Specified how old a character is, created a new (stub) note, added information to a note that was already present in another note. They're *kinda* important, but if it can be easily summarized here in the overview, it's probably a minor change. Also how big of an impact it has on other notes.

>[!tip]
>If you feel the need to add a priority to it, it's probably a major change. But feel free to do it anyway. Note that you can only assign one priority per note.

```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", sudoMinor as "Sudo's Changes", Priority, Sudosays, Lunsays
FROM #minorChange and #unseenByLun 
SORT !Priority, Priority, file.mtime DESC
```

## 3.3 Lun's changes

L: I don't write all that much anyway, so I streamlined my procedure for responding a bit to save some time. Just delete the "#lun" and "lunR::x" lines when you've read the thing and this should work pretty well I think?
I also sorted them in order that I wrote them ("Change number") so you can more easily follow my train of thought.
```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", lunR as "Change number", Lunsays, Sudosays
FROM #lun
SORT min(lunR), file.mtime DESC
```

## 3.4 Trivial Changes
>[!question] What's a trivial change?
>They're not unimportant, per se, but you don't need to open the note to see what changed. Fixing typos, changing links, adding new tags. Things of that sort.

```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", trivial as "Changes Made", Sudosays, Lunsays
FROM #trivialChange 
SORT file.mtime DESC
```

# 4 Files with Music
```dataview
TABLE songTitle as "Title", songRemarks as "Remarks"
FROM #contains-music 
```

# 5 Unanswered Questions
```dataview
TABLE question as "Question(s)"
FROM #unanswered-questions
SORT file.name
```

# 6 Answered Questions
```dataview
TABLE aq AS "Question(s)"
FROM #answered-questions 
```

# 7 Stubs
```dataview
LIST FROM #stub 
```
# 8 All
```dataview
TABLE file.mday AS "Last changed", Lunsays, Sudosays
SORT file.mtime DESC
```
