%%I would like for this to not be self-referential, but whatever. (Why can't this be more like LaTeX?)%%

# 2 Focus
Files that need urgent attention (this is mostly just for quick access)
```dataview
TABLE FocusComment as "What Needs Work"
WHERE focus
```

# 3 Changes
## 3.1 Sudo's Changes
### 3.1.1 Chromatic Changes (New Songs)
```dataview
TABLE songTitleNew as "Title", songRemarksNew as "Remarks"
FROM #chromaticChange AND #unheardByLun
SORT file.mtime DESC
```

### 3.1.2 Changes Lun Should Really Look At (Major Changes)
>[!question] What's a major change?
>To paraphrase Potter Stewart, "You'll know one when you see one."

```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", sudoMajor as "Sudo's Changes", Priority, Sudosays, Lunsays
FROM #majorChange and #unseenByLun
SORT !(Priority), Priority, file.mtime DESC
```

### 3.1.3 Replies
You can click on the "ref" link, and it should take you directly to the comment I replied to. (Useful for longer articles.)

```dataview
TABLE R AS "Number", sudo AS "Reply"
FROM #reply 
SORT min(R)
```
%%
It would be cool if the number linked directly to the block where the reply is, but I can't figure out how to do this.

### 3.1.4 Changes Lun Should Probably Look At (Minor Changes)
>[!question] What's a minor change?
>This is also subjective, but I think it does have more to do with "amount changed" than Major Changes do. Examples: Specified how old a character is, created a new (stub) note, added information to a note that was already present in another note. They're *kinda* important, but if it can be easily summarized here in the overview, it's probably a minor change. Also how big of an impact it has on other notes.

>[!tip]
>If you feel the need to add a priority to it, it's probably a major change. But feel free to do it anyway. Note that you can only assign one priority per note.

```dataview
TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", sudoMinor as "Sudo's Changes", Priority, Sudosays, Lunsays
FROM #minorChange and #unseenByLun 
SORT !Priority, Priority, file.mtime DESC
```

## 3.2 Lun's changes

TABLE file.mday as "Last Changed", lunR as "Change number", Lunsays, Sudosays
FROM #lun
SORT min(lunR), file.mtime DESC
```

```
