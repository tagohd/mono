sudoChange:: Still working on this, obviously.
Priority:: 1

To be combined with [[2.1 Timeline]]. Let's use Vogler's outline of the Hero's Journey for now since it's simpler.

1. Ordinary World
	1. [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] lives a boring life in a boring town called ~~Boringsville~~ [[Genton]]. %%Aside: My 10th grade English teacher hated the word "boring". We were forbidden from using it; we could use any other word, just not that. Sorry, Mr. Pool.%%
	2. His next door neighbor/best friend/partner is [[Sam Ward|Sam]]. He loves them so much that he even joined the cross-country team to spend more time with them, despite hating running.
2. Call to Adventure
	1. Sam goes missing.
	2. Luke goes to look for them at the [[Plata Fairgrounds|Renaissance Faire]].
	3. Luke does not find Sam, but he does hear a rumor about the return of [[CURSED AL]], an evil wizard who disappeared over 20 years ago. Luke has an active imagination, but he's pretty sure this wizard isn't involved in Sam's disappearance. (Spoiler: he is.)
		1. I guess since magic is so common in this world, being kidnapped by a wizard is more akin to being abducted by government scientists or something. It's something that *could* happen, but it's not very likely. I'm just saying, you could replace "wizard" with "plumber" or "electrical engineer", and it wouldn't affect the story that much. (There's also the fact that AL is over 350 years old, though I'm not sure how many people in-universe are aware of this.) 
	4. [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|Edna]] shows up at the Faire. She doesn't do anything, but everyone freaks the fuck out when an actual dragon shows up. Luke's horse, [[Luke's Noble Steed|Pauline]], is so terrified that she runs right off a cliff. The whole experience is kinda traumatic for Luke (and everyone else, but Luke is the main character).
		1. Even though they live in a world where magic is real and about as commonplace as electricity, most people think dragons are just the stuff of fantasy. This is because dragons tend to be fairly reclusive, and, consequently, very few people have ever seen one. But they're reclusive because whenever they *do* show up, *that* happens. Just like people, dragons run the gamut in terms of personality, but overall, they tend to be fairly chill. Most dragons don't want to attack anybody. They *are* very large, though, and much of the "human" world was not built to accommodate them, so they're prone to accidentally causing minor catastrophic property damage.
		2. Seeing a dragon, which he previously thought only existed in fairy tales, causes Luke to reconsider whether the ~~wizard~~ electrical engineer who disappeared before Luke was even born might be involved. Anything could be possible now.
	5. [[Case Weston|Case]] shows up to help with the disaster response and spots Luke, who is looking rather shell-shocked. He checks to see if Luke is alright. Luke tells Case everything that happened, including the rumor about CURSED AL. Case tells Luke about the Weird Old Guy (TM) he met at work who introduced himself as Alain, and jokingly suggests that maybe that was CURSED AL, unaware that it really was. Luke insists that Case take him to meet James immediately for more information. (I guess he knows AL and [[James Redawić|James]] are connected? Or Case tells him that James is also an engineer?)
3. Refusal of the Call
	1. James initially refuses to meet with Case and Luke. It's night, and he's trying to relax at home. But his mood quickly changes when Luke mentions CURSED AL. James senses how desperately Luke wants to find Sam and realizes he can manipulate Luke into finding the [[Legendary Artifacts]] he needs to cast [[Wizard Divorce]].
	2. "Oh, yes, you absolutely must stop CURSED AL. What he wants to do could potentially destroy the entire universe (lie?). You must find the Legendary Artifacts. These are the only things that can give you the power to defeat him (lie?). This will be a dangerous quest, for sure (this one's not a lie, actually), but you are the only one capable of doing it (lie). I can sense this in your [[SOUL]] (lie)."
	3. "Mr. Redawić, sir, I don't mean any disrespect, but I am 16 years old, and I have just had the worst night of my entire life. I just survived a dragon attack which upended my entire worldview and killed my horse. I watched [[Boring Straight Greg|a man]] get trampled to death in front of me, then I found out my partner has been kidnapped by an evil engineer who plans to do who knows what with them. My legs hurt, I have a splitting headache, I'm covered in soot and mud and manure, and to top it all off, I miss [[The Mothers Campbell|my moms]]. Please, sir, I don't think I'm right person for this job."
4. Meeting with the Mentor
	1. Overlaps with 2 and 3?
	2. James teaches Luke some magic
5. Crossing the First Threshold
	1. Luke gets [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]] from [[Rhapsody]]?
6. Tests, allies, and enemies
	1. Luke and Case go and get more Artifacts
7. Approach to the inmost cave
	1. AL kicks Luke's ass, takes the Artifacts, and tells Luke that James has been lying to him
8. The Ordeal
	1. In a moment of impulsive rage, Luke kills James. Luke is utterly fucked. Not only has he just killed a man, he killed the guy who was teaching him spells and who may or may not have been able to help him defeat AL.
	2. AL activates the [[BFS 10000]] to resurrect James, but Luke is able to communicate with Sam and gets them to override [[Reverse Fate]] somehow.
