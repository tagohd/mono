# 1 First Loop
## 1.1 Departure
### 1.1.1 Ordinary World
- [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] lives a boring life in a boring town called [[Genton]]. We've been over this many times already. Nothing new here.

### 1.1.2 Call to Adventure
- [[Sam Ward|Sam]] disappears. Luke goes looking for them in [[Plata]].
- [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|Edna]] attacks.
- Luke is introduced to [[James Redawić|James]] and [[Case Weston|Case]]. Luke learns Sam has been kidnapped by [[CURSED AL]].
- James tells Luke that he is THE CHOSEN ONE or some bullshit.

### 1.1.3 Refusal of the Call
- It's not that Luke doesn't want to be THE CHOSEN ONE. He wants to save Sam, of course. But is he really the right person for the job? He's only 16. He was terrified when Edna attacked. And he doesn't know magic. (Well, won't know unless he tries...)
	- I'm kinda worried that this could be at odds with Luke's defining personality traits: being an idiot and being in love with Sam. I guess we need to make sure that we frame it more as a matter of self-doubt.

### 1.1.4 Meeting with the Mentor
- James reluctantly agrees to teach Luke the magic he needs to know. He'll also send Case along with him.
- Luke agrees to be taught.

### 1.1.5 Crossing the First Threshold
- Luke returns home to tell [[The Mothers Campbell|his moms]] he is leaving to save Sam. They are, quite reasonably, not very enthusiastic about this, largely for the same reasons as Luke.
	- Luke's like, "I was surprised about this, too, but I must have what it takes since I'm THE CHOSEN ONE."
	- One of his mothers (probably [[Elizabeth Campbell|Elizabeth]], since she's supposed to be the smart one) asks if he's sure James is right about him being THE CHOSEN ONE.
	- Case assures her that James is himself a powerful wizard and probably knows what he's talking about. (Case is there because he drove Luke home from Plata.)
- Luke's mothers relent and decide to let him go. They know he would go anyway. They give him some supplies to get him ready for his journey.
	- Maybe among the supplies is [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]]?

## 1.2 Initiation
### 1.2.1 Tests, Allies, and Enemies
- Luke learns some spells
- James is pushing Luke really hard, and Luke's not doing that well with it. He perseveres because he believes it's necessary to save Sam. (He'll just have to try harder.)

### 1.2.2 The Approach/Approach to the Inmost Cave
- Luke and Case set out to gather the [[Legendary Artifacts]]
- The first Artifact he gets is [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]], located in [[Rhapsody]]
	- Amazingly, the warehouse where it's kept is not very closely guarded. Seems like a pretty easy mission...
	- ...Until they accidentally trigger the security systems
	- Luke has been struggling a lot with his lessons, occasionally doubting whether he truly is THE CHOSEN ONE, but he manages to cast a powerful spell, saving Case from a close call
	- It's not a spell Luke should know. It's way above his level, and he gets some pretty bad [[Mana#Mana Toxicity|Mana toxicity]] symptoms. But, it's a good boost to his confidence. (I'm also going to say right now that the more severe symptoms don't always kick in right away. They have enough time to get out of the warehouse, and maybe they'll even be partway back to Plata before Luke really begins to feel it. And, of course, this will happen less frequently as he builds tolerance.)
	- Case is surprised that Luke knew that spell but figures James's intense training must really be working. Though if/when he realizes that Luke is experiencing severe mana toxicity, he's going to be very pissed at James. (James: Well, he saved your life, didn't he? And he's still alive. I don't see what the problem is here.)
		- Luke would probably try to hide this from Case. Mix of animal instinct to hide pain, desire to look cool in front of Case, not wanting him to worry, and of course, denial.
- They also get [[BLADE OF POWER|THE BLADE]] and [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM|THE STAFF]]. (If Luke is already in possession of [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]], this means they now have 4 of the 7 Artifacts.)
	- What if all of them are actually pretty easy to get? Undermines James's insistence on intense training, which might actually be making things worse. (I want James to *feel* justified in mistreating Luke, but I don't want him to *be* justified.)
- AL already has [[CRYSTAL OF GRELLNATH|THE CRYSTAL]] since he needed it to summon [[Emperoress, The|The Emperoress]], and he may have one of the other Artifacts as well.

### 1.2.3 The Ordeal
- While attempting to retrieve [[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH|THE CHALICE]], Luke encounters AL for the first time. Despite James's "best" efforts, he is woefully unprepared, and AL beats him handily.
- Case, who is separated from Luke for reasons yet to be determined, shows up in the nick of time to save Luke, repaying him for saving his life in Rhapsody.
	- He's investigating James, since that's supposed to be the reason he works for James in the first place.
- Luke wonders why he lost if he's THE CHOSEN ONE. Case assures him that it's simply because he hasn't completed his training. (And maybe there's a sweet moment where Case promises that he'll never let Luke face AL alone again.)
	- So maybe the timeline without Case is the one where AL tells Luke that James is just using him...
	- He'll just have to try harder.

### 1.2.4 Reward
- Luke returns to finish his training. James teaches him a very powerful spell, but Luke accidentally kills James when he tries to cast it.
- As he dies, James begrudgingly admits that he is proud of Luke, and that he has a message for Luke to deliver to AL when next they meet: James still remembers AL.

## 1.3 Return
### 1.3.1 The Road Back
- Luke and Case make their way to [[CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN]].
	- Even if collecting The Artifacts was easy, this is going to be a challenge.
- With the spell and the message, Luke should be able to defeat AL. 

### 1.3.2 The Resurrection
- Despite this, AL is *still* able to defeat them easily.
- Case sacrifices himself to save Luke.
- Just as AL is preparing to cast [[Reverse Fate]], Luke cries out for him to wait. He has a message from James.
	- Lol, what if AL's reaction is just, "Yeah, I'd fucking hope he remembers me. We were married for like 200 years..."
- Regardless of AL's reaction, he's distracted long enough for Sam to do some shenanigans
- AL casts Reverse Fate, but instead of resurrecting James, it resets the timeline to the beginning of the story, except Sam no longer exists.

### 1.3.3 The Return/Return with the Elixir
- Nope. Not on this timeline.

# 2 Second Loop
## 2.1 Departure
### 2.1.1 Ordinary World
- Luke lives a boring life in a boring town called Genton. He can't help but feel that something is missing from his life, but what?

### 2.1.2 Call to Adventure
- He'll be going to the [[Plata Fairgrounds|Renaissance Faire]] this weekend, but something feels off. For some reason, he feels compelled to go there early.
	- Maybe he had a dream about Sam the night before. He might not have recognized them, however.
- When Edna attacks, Luke experiences déjà vu. He feels that he came here to look for someone.
	- Also, maybe he's a bit less frightened by the attack since it's happened before.
- He sees Case. Is this the person he's looking for? He looks familiar...
- The déjà vu intensifies. Luke freaks out. Case gets James to help.
	- Maybe Case senses that the déjà vu is magical in origin?

### 2.1.3 Refusal of the Call
- James confirms that the déjà vu is real. Luke really has done this before.
	- James suspects this is the work of CURSED AL.
	- If Luke wants to break the time loop, he'll need to gather the Legendary Artifacts and defeat AL.
- Luke may question how good of a CHOSEN ONE he really is since he's apparently failed to break the time loop, but he ultimately resigns himself to his fate. (He'll just have to try harder.)

### 2.1.4 Meeting with the Mentor
- James reluctantly agrees to teach Luke the magic he needs to know. He'll also send Case along with him.
- Luke agrees to be taught.

### 2.1.5 Crossing the First Threshold
- Luke returns home to tell his parents he's going on a quest. Maybe Case helps him make it sound less insane than saying he's saving a person who never existed.
- Luke's moms aren't super stoked about this, but hey! Their son is THE CHOSEN ONE! That's something to be proud of, right? Plus, who are they to interfere with fate?
- They give him some supplies, including THE NEEDLE.

## 2.2 Initiation
### 2.2.1 Tests, Allies, and Enemies
- Luke learns some spells
- James is pushing Luke really hard, and Luke's not doing that well with it. (He'll just have to try harder.) He perseveres because he believes it's necessary to save ~~Sam~~ someone.

### 2.2.2 The Approach
- Luke and Case set out to gather the Legendary Artifacts
- The first Artifact he gets is THE ORB, located in Rhapsody
	- Luke saves Case, but suffers from Mana toxicity
	- Case maybe doesn't know that Luke is suffering from Mana toxicity
- They also get THE BLADE and THE STAFF.

### 2.2.3 The Ordeal
- While attempting to retrieve THE CHALICE, Luke encounters AL for the "first" time. Despite James's "best" efforts, he is woefully unprepared, and AL beats him handily.
- Case, who is separated from Luke because he's busy investigating James, shows up in the nick of time to save Luke, repaying him for saving his life in Rhapsody.
- Luke wonders why he lost if he's THE CHOSEN ONE. Case assures him that it's simply because he hasn't completed his training. (And maybe there's a sweet moment where Case promises that he'll never let Luke face AL alone again.)
	- He'll just have to try harder.

### 2.2.4 Reward
- Luke returns to finish his training. James teaches him a very powerful spell, but Luke accidentally kills James when he tries to cast it. Maybe Luke has some more déjà vu about this, but it's too little, too late.
- As he dies, James begrudgingly admits that he is proud of Luke, and that he has a message for Luke to deliver to AL when next they meet: James still remembers AL.

## 2.3 Return
### 2.3.1 The Road Back
- Luke and Case make their way to CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN.
	- Even if collecting The Artifacts was easy, this is going to be a challenge.
- With the spell and the message, Luke should be able to defeat AL.

### 2.3.2 The Resurrection
- Despite this, AL is *still* able to defeat them easily. (He'll just have to try harder.)
- Case sacrifices himself to save Luke.
- Just as AL is preparing to cast Reverse Fate, Luke cries out for him to wait. He has a message from James.
- AL casts Reverse Fate anyway, but, for some reason, instead of resurrecting James, it resets the timeline to the beginning of the story.

### 2.3.3 The Return
![[no-jonathan-frakes.gif]]

This probably repeats a few times, then:

# 3 "Third" Loop
## 3.1 Departure
### 3.1.1 Ordinary World
- Luke lives a boring life in a boring town called Genton. At least, it *was* boring until his partner, Sam, was wiped from existence. Now he actively wishes it was still boring. He's tired of this shit, man. He just wants it to be over. But he doesn't know how to do that yet. (He'll just have to try harder.)

### 3.1.2 Call to Adventure
- Luke knows Sam isn't going to be at the Renaissance Faire.
- But he also knows Edna is going to "attack". He goes anyway.
	- What does he do? Does he try to warn people? Would anyone believe him?
	- Perhaps he finally notices that Edna seems particularly interested in Pauline...
- He sees Case, or perhaps Case sees him. The memories of Case's deaths (plural) make Luke feel sick, but he holds back. He doesn't want Case to get involved this time.
- Case observes Luke's composure during the dragon attack and finds it suspicious (but also kinda attractive?). It's almost like Luke knew this was coming...
	- "Wow, you were pretty brave out there. Most people would have panicked during a dragon attack, as you can tell, but you didn't."
	- (visibly distressed) "Oh. I'm... not brave. Like, at all. Please leave me alone. I can't bear to watch you die again."
- This obviously weirds Case the fuck out. He reports it to James, who wants to meet Luke.

### 3.1.3 Refusal of the Case
- James prepares to go out and find Luke, but Luke is already outside his door. He announces that he knows he is THE CHOSEN ONE and that he's experiencing a time loop. He doesn't know how to fix it, but he knows James can help.
- James concurs and agrees to teach Luke the magic that Luke already kinda knows. He'll also send Case along to help Luke on his quest.
- Luke objects to this. Maybe he argues that Case was with him on all the previous timelines, and they still lost, so he wants to try something different. (Too smart?) Or maybe he's just forthright and says he's tired of watching Case die.
- James disagrees (he knows Case was sent by [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]]), but he is unable to convince Luke. Luke will have to learn the hard way that this is a bad plan.

### 3.1.4 Meeting with the Mentor
- Combined with above.

### 3.1.5 Crossing the First Threshold
- By this point, Luke probably knows to tell his mothers in advance, so he already has the supplies, including THE NEEDLE. He'll start training with James first thing in the morning.

## 3.2 Initiation
### 3.2.1 Tests, Allies, and Enemies
- James is still kind of a dick, even though Luke has more experience this time around.
	- "Oh, wow. Your form was almost perfect. Perfectly wrong! Do it again, but do it right."
	- He'll just have to try harder.
- Maybe James makes Luke train with Case anyway, hoping Luke changes his mind.
	- See what I wrote in the "Case File (get it?)" thread on Discord, but maybe Case is ostensibly there to learn magic from James, and IMAS is just using him as a way to keep tabs on James.
	- And maybe he's also trying to set them up a little? Not that James actually cares—he just wants Case gone—but if Case is going to show up later anyway during [[Outline#3.2.3 The Ordeal|The Ordeal]], then it would probably make more sense if he at least knew Luke a little better.
		- Luke would probably have a hard time opening up, though.

### 3.2.2 The Approach
- This isn't fun anymore without Case. Luke doesn't even care about the [[Chocolate Orange]] in Rhapsody.
	- He's not eating much at all, lately. And he hasn't been sleeping well, either. He's constantly on edge. How can he sleep when the world is counting on him? When Sam is counting on him? When every time he sleeps, he sees his failure at the end of each loop? When every time he closes his eyes, the air fills with the scent of iron? ~~Case screams~~ he couldn't make a sound. ~~Luke runs towards him~~ he couldn't move. ~~It lasts an eternity~~ it was over in a minute. But it never really ends, does it? In his dreams and in his life. ~~It would be better to just die.~~ Some CHOSEN ONE he is. ~~It would be better to just die.~~ He has to keep going regardless. He'll just have to try harder. ~~Can he try any harder?~~
	- Since the playfighting with Case was what triggered the security system in the previous timelines (see [[1.4 The Crossing of the First Threshold]]), maybe that doesn't happen this time.
	- Probably a good thing. In the state that he's in, Mana Toxicity would be way worse than usual.
- He also gets THE BLADE and THE STAFF.
	- Even though it's mostly as easy as before, Luke finds it more difficult than ever. Too many memories with Case along the way, especially when it comes to THE STAFF. (Also, it probably is at least slightly harder even without that. Luke has more experience, but now he's by himself.)

### 3.2.3 The Ordeal
- Despite being in a constant state of hypervigilance, AL still catches Luke by surprise while he's attempting to retrieve THE CHALICE.
- Luke tries to defend himself, but, as stated above, his Mana tolerance is kinda fucked.
- Again, Luke wonders what kind of CHOSEN ONE he must be if he can be beaten so easily. (He'll just have to try harder.)
- Then this happens: 
![[queen of england.jpeg]] 
- Maybe Case shows up anyway because he's discovered TEH DARK TRUTH \[sic\] about James
	- Luke is obviously going to have some very mixed feelings about seeing Case right now.

### 3.2.4 Reward
- Luke accidentally(?) kills James. Again, with the whole PTSD thing Luke has going on, he's going to have some major side effects from casting the powerful spell James teaches him. (By this point, he has built up some tolerance, but it's still going to hit harder than normal.)
	- At some point, I should probably decide what this spell is
- James wants Luke to deliver his message to AL
- Maybe Luke has another existential crisis about what a bad CHOSEN ONE he is since he doesn't feel bad enough about killing James. (He'll just have to try harder?)

## 3.3 Return
### 3.3.1 The Road Back
- This is the place.
- This is where it happens.
- What am I doing here?
- I can't be here!
- Holy fuck, I have to leave!
- Why did I come here?
- I can't breathe!
- I need out of here!
![[mr bones wild ride.jpg]]
- He can't try any harder.
- He can't do it alone.

### 3.3.2 The Resurrection
- AL casts Reverse Fate, uninterrupted by Luke or Case.
- The timeline resets.

### 3.3.3 The Return
