Note to self: Just an outline, okay? Don't worry about the details yet. That comes later.

There might be even more loops, but keep in mind that we're not necessarily going to show the whole loop each time.

# 1 First Loop
## 1.1 Departure
### 1.1.1 Ordinary World
- [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] lives a boring life in a boring town called [[Genton]]. We've been over this many times already. Nothing new here.

### 1.1.2 Call to Adventure
- [[Sam Ward|Sam]] doesn't show up for their morning run with Luke. The [[Plata Fairgrounds|Renaissance Faire]] is this weekend, and this will be Sam's first time attending. Luke suspects they were simply overeager and left early (because that's the kind of thing *he* would do). He saddles up [[Luke's Noble Steed|Pauline]] and starts riding towards [[Plata]].
	- Luke jousts, so he'll need Pauline there anyway.
	- Plata is only 35 km (21.75 mi) away from Genton. He can get there on horseback no problem, but it will take a while.
		- About 20-30 minutes by car, but at least a couple hours by horse.
			- Assuming Pauline is in good shape, she can probably maintain a trot of 8-12 mph for 20 miles, so it would take approximately 2 hours at that speed.
			- Luke probably won't ride that fast so she doesn't get exhausted, plus they'll need to stop for water every so often. So, let's say it takes about 3 hours? (Not 5.5 hours like I've said previously.)
		- Ideally, he would take Pauline there in a horse trailer, but Luke isn't a very good driver.
		- Couldn't he just ask one of [[The Mothers Campbell|his moms]] to take him? Well, he's *supposed* to be in school that day. Also, they're busy. [[Elizabeth Campbell|Elizabeth]] is going to take him tomorrow, though.
		- Actually, it's 35 km as measured from the center of Genton to the center of Plata. But Luke doesn't live in Genton proper. [[Campbell Farms]] is likely on the outskirts, so it could be a bit closer.
	- Does he put on his armor before he leaves?
		- Can he do that by himself? (Depends on the armor, but it's possible.)
		- Can he mount Pauline unassisted if he does? (Might be kinda hard, especially with his hip problems.)
		- Wouldn't that be kinda uncomfortable to wear all day? (At least the weather is probably pretty cool.)
		- If he doesn't put it on before he leaves, how does he get it there? And when *does* he put it on?
- [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|Edna]] attacks.
	- Well, people assume she's attacking, but she doesn't really do anything. Everyone freaks out anyway, resulting in a riot.
	- Pauline is injured in the ensuing chaos.
	- Luke is not having a good time.
- [[Case Weston|Case]] shows up. He wasn't attending the Faire, but he, too, is a Good Boy (TM), and he's there to help if he can.
	- He spots Luke, who is clearly shaken up and trying desperately to keep Pauline under control so she doesn't exacerbate her injuries.
	- Case knows a little bit of healing magic, so he heals Pauline, but she should still probably be checked by a professional.
	- If he hasn't already, this would probably be a good time for Luke to take off his armor. Maybe Case suggests it. Like, "Hey, you're kinda freaking out right now, and that's a totally valid reaction to surviving a dragon attack, but maybe you'd feel better if you weren't wearing fucking plate armor?"
- Luke asks Case if he's seen anyone who looks like Sam. He still hasn't found them, and now he's worried that maybe they were kidnapped by the dragon.
	- He hasn't, and he's not sure about that last part. Maybe [[James Redawić|James]] would know more.
- James is offended by the suggestion that Edna would kidnap anyone. No, it's more likely that Sam was kidnapped by [[CURSED AL]].
	- How does James know this? He doesn't. He just knows that AL has returned, and whatever he's planning is probably going to require at least a few sacrifices.
- Sensing Luke's desperation to save Sam, James sees an opportunity: he can use Luke to gather the materials he will need to cast [[Wizard Divorce]] and be rid of AL for good.
	- He tells Luke that it was clearly fate that brought him here. Luke must be THE CHOSEN ONE foretold by the prophecy James is *totally* not making up on the spot.

### 1.1.3 Refusal of the Call
- It's not that Luke doesn't want to be THE CHOSEN ONE. He wants to save Sam, of course. But is he really the right person for the job? He's only 16. He was terrified when Edna attacked. And he doesn't know magic. (Well, won't know unless he tries...)
- Refusing the call is part of the prophecy, so obviously this means that Luke really is THE CHOSEN ONE. Luke is not smart enough to question this any further.

### 1.1.4 Meeting with the Mentor
- James reluctantly agrees to teach Luke the magic he needs to know. He'll also send Case along with him.
	- **James:** Excellent! According to the prophecy, you must first gather the seven [[Legendary Artifacts]]. AL will be seeking these as well, but it is vital that you find them first.
	- **Luke:** Right, okay, one problem.
	- **James:** What?
	- **Luke:** AL's a wizard, right? And I don't know if you heard me earlier, but I don't know magic. I barely even know algebra.
	- **James:** Yes... Right, I can see how that would be a concern. Since AL likely has a significant head start, (*slightly sarcastic*) it seems the honor of instructing THE CHOSEN ONE has fallen upon me. However, it is quite late \[22:00 (lol)\]. We will begin your training first thing in the morning. Mr Weston, you may wish to join as well.
	- **James:** In the meantime, I suggest you freshen up. I can tell you were quite... active, today.
	- **Luke:** Sir?
	- **James:** Go home and take a shower, kid. You reek. Maybe tell your parents you're THE CHOSEN ONE; I'm sure they'll be thrilled. But be back here at sunup. We have a lot of ground to cover.
		- In my head, I feel like his voice suddenly switched from Obi-Wan Kenobi to J. Jonah Jameson. (Or perhaps from Hero (OMORI) to Mr Jawsum.) Maybe the "sagely British guy" act is just that: an act. (Or maybe it's just: he would not fucking say that.)
		- Wait, that might be kinda weird for Case, then. Since Luke's going to be riding bitch on his motorcycle. (Maybe not. It is a motorcycle.)
	- **Luke:** Yessir. Thank you, sir!
	- **James:** Don't thank me yet. Now, go!

### 1.1.5 Crossing the First Threshold
- Luke returns home to tell [[The Mothers Campbell|his moms]] he is leaving to save Sam. They are, quite reasonably, not very enthusiastic about this, largely for the same reasons as Luke.
	- Luke's like, "I was surprised about this, too, but I must have what it takes since I'm THE CHOSEN ONE."
	- One of his mothers (probably [[Elizabeth Campbell|Elizabeth]], since she's supposed to be the smart one) asks if he's sure James is right about him being THE CHOSEN ONE.
	- Case assures her that James is himself a powerful wizard and probably knows what he's talking about. (Case is there because he drove Luke home from Plata.)
		- Is Case gonna stay the night? Again, Plata isn't that far, but it is late, and Luke's parents are good people. They might want him to stay just to be safe. At the very least, they'll want to thank him for helping their son—he gets some supplies, too.
		- If Luke's back on the farm, how is he returning to Plata? Is Case taking him? Could make sense if he's staying the night, less so if he isn't. But, 1) Pauline is still in Plata, so someone's going to have to get her, and 2) before he left on his own to look for Sam, the original plan was that Elizabeth would drive him to the Renaissance Faire tomorrow, anyway.
		- Why did Case drive Luke back from Plata, anyway? (Because I wanted it to happen.)
			- Why didn't one of his moms just pick him up?
				- Luke's an idiot, and it didn't occur him to call one of them? (I was thinking more that they would come there on their own, assuming they heard about the dragon. So that's not really an answer...)
				- Case volunteered? Not because he likes him or anything. (I know we've said he's tsundere, but also: they literally just met. It's really not because he likes him.) But, Luke *is* THE CHOSEN ONE. Maybe he views it as an honor? Though, like I said, Case is also a Good Boy (TM), so he would probably do it even if Luke was Just Some Guy (which he is).
			- Why didn't he ride Pauline back? This one's easy: it's 20-30 minutes by motorcycle, but ~3 hours by horse. Plus, even if Edna didn't happen, Luke already rode her *to* Plata. She's tired. (Also, shouldn't his parents have noticed earlier that Pauline was missing, even if they assumed Luke was at school? Were all three of his moms away?)
			- Why doesn't he just take a train? I'm American, so correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems unlikely that there would be a train between two small towns that also runs at night. You might be able to catch a train from Plata to Rhapsody at that hour, but not one that's going to stop in Genton.
		- Where does Case even live? Did IMAS set him up with an apartment? Is he staying with James and [[Grigori Karstov|Grigori]]? (See the "Case File" thread.) Would James be okay with that? (He's probably not thrilled.)
- Luke's mothers relent and decide to let him go. They know he would go anyway. They give him some supplies to get him ready for his journey. Among the supplies is [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]], one of the Legendary Artifacts.
	- I don't think any of them are aware that it's a Legendary Artifact.

## 1.2 Initiation
### 1.2.1 Tests, Allies, and Enemies
- Luke and Case learn some spells
	- Case is older and smarter than Luke, plus he took some magic classes in [[Paul W. Friendship High School|high school]], so he has a bit of an advantage over Luke.
	- This may cause Luke to view Case as something of a rival. (Luke is competitive?)
	- Case doesn't see it that way (it's not a competition; they're trying to save the world). But maybe he's a little bit jealous that Luke gets to be THE CHOSEN ONE. This may reverse as the loops continue and Luke ends up more skilled.
	- What spells do they learn? How many do they learn before James starts sending them after the Artifacts?
- James is pushing Luke really hard, and Luke's not doing that well with it. (He'll just have to try harder.) He perseveres because he believes it's necessary to save Sam.
	- If Case is there, wouldn't he have some objections to James's teaching methods?
		- Oh. If I do give him the sad backstory that I mentioned in "Case File", maybe he just... thinks it's normal? Like, "Yep, this is how people are taught things."
		- Or he doesn't feel it's safe for him to object, especially if he lives with James. James might turn his abuse towards Case instead, or threaten to kick him out. (Even if James wouldn't kick him out (Grigori would kill him), it's still something Case *thinks* could happen, because maybe it wouldn't be the first time.)
			- "Case intentionally draws the abuse to get James to ease off Luke" - No. I don't know how to explain it, but that does not sit right with me. Like he's being abused "heroically"? Like it's *his* fault for not stopping Luke from being abused, and not James's fault for abusing both of them in the first place? (Though Case very well might think that, similar to how Luke thinks it's his fault Case dies. Doesn't mean either is correct.) But I think the big thing is this: it is perfectly rational that Case would not want to be abused either.
			- Ooh, wait. Maybe on the timeline without Case, James really does kick Case out, and Grigori is the one who kills James. Or Luke still kills him, but it's definitely not an accident. (Bonus: Luke's like, "Great, even though he didn't die, I still ended up making his life worse.")

### 1.2.2 The Approach/Approach to the Inmost Cave
- Luke and Case set out to gather the [[Legendary Artifacts]]
- The first Artifact they get is [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]], located in [[Rhapsody]]
	- Amazingly, the warehouse where it's kept is not very closely guarded. Seems like a pretty easy mission...
	- ...Until they accidentally trigger the security systems
	- Luke has been struggling a lot with his lessons, occasionally doubting whether he truly is THE CHOSEN ONE, but he manages to cast a powerful spell, saving Case from a close call
	- It's not a spell Luke should know. It's way above his level, and he gets some pretty bad [[Mana#Mana Toxicity|Mana toxicity]] symptoms. But, it's a good boost to his confidence. (I'm also going to say right now that the more severe symptoms don't always kick in right away. They have enough time to get out of the warehouse, and maybe they'll even be partway back to Plata before Luke really begins to feel it. And, of course, this will happen less frequently as he builds tolerance.)
	- Case is surprised that Luke knew that spell but figures James's intense training must really be working. Though if/when he realizes that Luke is experiencing severe mana toxicity, he's going to be very pissed at James. (James: Well, he saved your life, didn't he? And he's still alive. I don't see what the problem is here.)
		- Luke would probably try to hide this from Case. Mix of animal instinct to hide pain, desire to look cool in front of Case, not wanting him to worry, and of course, denial.
		- If they've been training together, the surprise is likely more that Luke managed to do it, not that he knew the spell in the first place. So, it's more like, "Hey! You finally did it! I know you've been struggling with that spell, so great job!"
		- Likewise, Case might not be surprised that Luke is suffering from Mana toxicity. It's that Case has never seen such a severe case of it in person before. It's one thing to read about the symptoms in a book, but seeing it happen right in front of you is obviously more visceral.
- They also get [[BLADE OF POWER|THE BLADE]] and [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM|THE STAFF]]. (If Luke is already in possession of [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]], this means they now have 4 of the 7 Artifacts.)
	- If you're reading this, you should also read the article for [[BLADE OF POWER|THE BLADE]].
	- What if all of them are actually pretty easy to get? Undermines James's insistence on intense training, which might actually be making things worse. (I want James to *feel* justified in mistreating Luke, but I don't want him to *be* justified.)
	- Well, okay, there should be *some* challenges involved, otherwise the story would get kinda boring. But maybe they don't really require that much magic to solve.
- AL already has [[CRYSTAL OF GRELLNATH|THE CRYSTAL]] since he needed it to summon [[Emperoress, The|The Emperoress]], and he may have one of the other Artifacts as well.
	- Maybe they try to get THE CRYSTAL anyway, only to find that it isn't there.

### 1.2.3 The Ordeal
- While attempting to retrieve [[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH|THE CHALICE]], Luke encounters AL for the first time. Despite James's "best" efforts, he is woefully unprepared, and AL beats him handily.
- Case, who is separated from Luke for reasons yet to be determined, shows up in the nick of time to save Luke, repaying him for saving his life in Rhapsody.
	- Maybe they split up to find THE CHALICE faster?
	- Or maybe he was looking for [[BEE|THE BRIEFCASE OF BEES]].
- Luke wonders why he lost if he's THE CHOSEN ONE. (He'll just have to try harder.) Case assures him that it's simply because he hasn't completed his training. (And maybe there's a sweet moment where Case promises that he'll never let Luke face AL alone again.)

### 1.2.4 Reward
- Luke returns to finish his training. James teaches him a very powerful spell, but Luke accidentally kills James when he tries to cast it.
	- Let's say the spell is [[Greater Fuck You Up Big Time]] for now.
- As he dies, James begrudgingly admits that he is proud of Luke, and that he has a message for Luke to deliver to AL when next they meet: James still remembers AL.
	- Do Case and Luke know that AL is James's ex-husband? If they didn't, do they know now?

## 1.3 Return
### 1.3.1 The Road Back
- Luke and Case make their way to [[CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN]].
	- Even if collecting The Artifacts was easy, this is going to be a challenge.
- With the spell and the message, Luke should be able to defeat AL. 

### 1.3.2 The Resurrection
- Despite this, AL is *still* able to defeat them easily.
- Case sacrifices himself to save Luke.
- Just as AL is preparing to cast [[Reverse Fate]], Luke cries out for him to wait. He has a message from James.
	- Lol, what if AL's reaction is just, "Yeah, I'd fucking hope he remembers me. We were married for like 200 years..."
- Regardless of AL's reaction, he's distracted long enough for Sam to do some shenanigans
- AL casts Reverse Fate, but instead of resurrecting James, it resets the timeline to the beginning of the story, except Sam no longer exists.

### 1.3.3 The Return/Return with the Elixir
- Nope. Not on this timeline.

## 1.4 Lessons Learned
What does Luke remember from this timeline? Not much, really. Mostly just vague impressions. He might remember events as they're happening, but usually not to an extent than he can really do anything about them.

# 2 Second Loop
## 2.1 Departure
### 2.1.1 Ordinary World
- Luke lives a boring life in a boring town called Genton. He can't help but feel that something is missing from his life, but what?

### 2.1.2 Call to Adventure
- He'll be going to the [[Plata Fairgrounds|Renaissance Faire]] this weekend, but something feels off. For some reason, he feels compelled to go there early.
	- Maybe he had a dream about Sam the night before. He might not have recognized them, however.
- When Edna attacks, Luke experiences déjà vu. He feels that he came here to look for someone.
	- Also, maybe he's a bit less frightened by the attack since it's happened before.
- He sees Case. Is this the person he's looking for? He looks familiar...
- Luke mentions his weird dreams and déjà vu, and Case suggests they talk to James about it.

### 2.1.3 Refusal of the Call
- James confirms that the déjà vu is real. Luke really has done this before.
	- James suspects this is the work of CURSED AL.
	- If Luke wants to break the time loop, he'll need to gather the Legendary Artifacts and defeat AL.
- Luke may question how good of a CHOSEN ONE he really is since he's apparently failed to break the time loop, but he ultimately resigns himself to his fate. (He'll just have to try harder.)

### 2.1.4 Meeting with the Mentor
- James reluctantly agrees to teach Luke the magic he needs to know. He'll also send Case along with him.
- Luke agrees to be taught.

### 2.1.5 Crossing the First Threshold
- Luke returns home to tell his parents he's going on a quest. Maybe Case helps him make it sound less insane than saying he's saving a person who never existed.
- Luke's moms aren't super stoked about this, but hey! Their son is THE CHOSEN ONE! That's something to be proud of, right? Plus, who are they to interfere with fate?
- They give him some supplies, including THE NEEDLE.

## 2.2 Initiation
### 2.2.1 Tests, Allies, and Enemies
- Luke learns some spells
- James is pushing Luke really hard, and Luke's not doing that well with it. (He'll just have to try harder.) He perseveres because he believes it's necessary to save ~~Sam~~ someone.

### 2.2.2 The Approach
- Luke and Case set out to gather the Legendary Artifacts
- The first Artifact he gets is THE ORB, located in Rhapsody
	- Luke saves Case, but suffers from Mana toxicity
	- Case maybe doesn't know that Luke is suffering from Mana toxicity
- They also get THE BLADE and THE STAFF.

### 2.2.3 The Ordeal
- While attempting to retrieve THE CHALICE, Luke encounters AL for the "first" time. Despite James's "best" efforts, he is woefully unprepared, and AL beats him handily.
- Case, who is separated from Luke for some reason, shows up in the nick of time to save Luke, repaying him for saving his life in Rhapsody.

### 2.2.4 Reward
- Luke returns to finish his training. James teaches him a very powerful spell, but Luke accidentally kills James when he tries to cast it. Maybe Luke has some more déjà vu about this, but it's too little, too late.
- As he dies, James begrudgingly admits that he is proud of Luke, and that he has a message for Luke to deliver to AL when next they meet: James still remembers AL.

## 2.3 Return
### 2.3.1 The Road Back
- Luke and Case make their way to CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN.
	- Even if collecting The Artifacts was easy, this is going to be a challenge.
- With the spell and the message, Luke should be able to defeat AL.

### 2.3.2 The Resurrection

- Case sacrifices himself to save Luke.
- Just as AL is preparing to cast Reverse Fate, Luke cries out for him to wait. He has a message from James.

### 2.3.3 The Return
![[no-jonathan-frakes.gif]]

## 2.4 Lessons Learned
- Edna is going to "attack" the Renaissance Faire.
- Case is a friend.

# 3 Third Loop
## 3.1 Departure
### 3.1.1 Ordinary World
- Luke lives a boring life in a boring town called Genton. He can't help but feel that something is missing from his life, but what?

### 3.1.2 Call to Adventure
- He'll be going to the Renaissance Faire this weekend, but something feels off. For some reason, he feels compelled to go there early.
	- Maybe he can stop the dragon attack? (He can't.)
- He sees Case. He feels like he knows him somehow.
- He asks Case if he knows anything about the dragon. He doesn't, but he knows someone who might.
	- Luke mentions his premonition of the dragon attack.
	- He also states that he feels like someone is missing from his life. (Case: Is he hitting on me???)
- They go to meet James. Case suggests the two feelings are connected. Maybe Edna kidnapped this person (and wiped Luke's memory?).
- James rejects this theory.
	- **James:** First of all, this idea of dragons kidnapping princesses or anyone else is based on a racist myth. Historically, most princesses actually went willingly. And in modern times, you'll find that dragons don't commit kidnapping any more often than other species. In fact, they actually tend to commit fewer crimes overall.
	- **Luke:** Don't reckon I know any princesses. Didn't know we still had any in this country.
	- **James:** That's not my point!
	- **James:** But you say you had foresight of this dragon "attack", boy?
	- **Luke:** Name's Luke, sir. And no, sir. I only saw it twice. In my dreams last night, and again about an hour ago. \[They were already introduced. James is just rude.\]
	- **James \[pinching the bridge of his nose\]:** Out of curiosity, who is your father, Luke?
		- Why does he ask this? Does he already know?
			- I don't think it really matters. Even if Luke did have a father, James would have just made up a slightly different explanation. (Well, Luke *does* have a father; he's just gullible.)
	- **Luke:** Don't have one, sir. Sorry.
	- **James:** You... don't have one?
	- **Luke:** Yessir. My [[Loretta Campbell|Mama]] told me I'm a "virgin birth".
	- **James:** Interesting...

### 3.1.3 Refusal of the Call
- James tells Luke that he is THE CHOSEN ONE
	- **James:** I have a theory that may be able to explain all this. \[He draws on his pipe.\] If you truly are the son of a virgin, and you have been blessed with the gift of foresight, it seems to me that you are what we mages refer to as THE CHOSEN ONE.
	- **Luke:** THE CHOSEN ONE, sir? But... who would choose me? I'm always picked last.
	- **James:** Allow me to explain. Long ago, long before the kingdoms of Mevaro had united, when the mountains to the east were mere foothills, a prophecy foretold of a great evil. A powerful wizard named CURSED AL would wreak havoc on the timeline, seeking to bend reality to his will.
	- **Case:** Hey, isn't your ex named AL?
	- **James:** Be quiet, boy! Unbeknownst to AL, however, reality does not bend so easily. Rather than creating a new timeline, he would merely bend time into a loop. The people, including AL himself, would be doomed to repeat their lives over and over, until AL corrected his mistake or was stopped. But only THE CHOSEN ONE, a boy born unto a virgin, who had the power to remember the previous loops, would be able to stop him.
	- (Note: James is obviously just making this prophecy up. I haven't written dialogue for the other timelines yet (because that wasn't even the plan; this was supposed to just be basic plot points), but he would change the details to fit whatever Luke told him.)
	- **Luke:** Okay... what's this got to do with me?
	- **James:** Child, were you, by chance, ever dropped on your head as an infant?
	- **Luke:** I don't know how I'd remember that, but I don't think so.
	- **James:** So you're just this stupid naturally?
	- **Luke:** Hey!
	- **James:** What I'm saying is, your dream of the dragon attack was no prophecy. You were remembering the previous timeline, something only you can do because you are THE CHOSEN ONE, he who has the power to stop CURSED AL.
	- **Luke:** Ohhh...
- Luke isn't too sure about this
	- **Luke:** I'm really sorry, sir, but I think you have the wrong person. If what you say is true, and I'm remembering the dragon attack from a past life, wouldn't that mean I wasn't able to beat AL and break the loop? How could *I* possibly be THE CHOSEN ONE? I don't even know magic!
	- **James \[under his breath\]:** Oh, so you *were* paying attention...
	- **James:** That's surprisingly astute, my boy! Perhaps I didn't give you enough credit. Yes, you may well have repeated this cycle dozens or even hundreds of times. That doesn't change anything. The prophecy says nothing of how long it will take THE CHOSEN ONE to finish this task, only that he will eventually succeed. You have been given the opportunity to learn from your mistakes, but it is ultimately up to you to seize this opportunity.
	- **Luke:** But, what about this person that feels like they're missing from my life?
	- **James:** Yes... it seems likely that rather than being kidnapped by Edna—
	- **Luke:** Edna?
	- **James:** The dragon, [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder]], Tyrant of the Mountains. Did you think she didn't have a name? It's possible that this person was actually kidnapped by AL, and he's found some way to block them from your memories.
	- **Luke:** I know what you just said about dragons, sir, but I find it hard to believe anyone called the "Tyrant of the Mountains" is *good*.
	- **James:** My boy, I will try not to hold your ignorance against you, but you are severely testing my patience. I suggest you learn a bit more about draconic culture before you make an even bigger fool of yourself. In fact, here. Take this book. \[Luke's not going to read that.\]
	- **James:** Now, as I was saying, it's possible that this friend of yours—or perhaps they were more than a friend? You seem quite concerned for them despite not being sure they even exist. But perhaps this friend of yours was taken by CURSED AL himself. If that's so, then it's even more imperative you fulfill your duties as THE CHOSEN ONE. Who knows what wicked plans he may have in store for them?
	- **Luke:** You might be on to something, sir! I think they were my partner! Yer right, I owe it to them to be the very best CHOSEN ONE I can be. ~~Like no one ever was!~~

### 3.1.4 Meeting with the Mentor
- James reluctantly agrees to teach Luke the magic he needs to know. He'll also send Case along with him.
	- **James:** Excellent! According to the prophecy, you must first gather the seven Legendary Artifacts. AL will be seeking these as well, but it is vital that you find them first.
	- **Luke:** Right, okay, one problem.
	- **James:** What?
	- **Luke:** AL's a wizard, right? And I don't know if you heard me earlier, but I don't know magic. I barely even know algebra.
	- **James:** Yes... Right, I can see how that would be a concern. Since we don't know how long the loop is, or, indeed, how many more there will be before AL can stop them himself, (*slightly sarcastic*) it seems the honor of instructing THE CHOSEN ONE has fallen upon me. However, it is quite late \[22:00 (lol)\]. We will begin your training first thing in the morning. Mr Weston, you may wish to join as well.
	- **James:** In the meantime, I suggest you freshen up. I can tell you were quite... active, today.
	- **Luke:** Sir?
	- **James:** Go home and take a shower, kid. You reek. Maybe tell your parents you're THE CHOSEN ONE; I'm sure they'll be thrilled. But be back here at sunup. We have a lot of ground to cover.
	- **Luke:** Yessir. Thank you, sir!
	- **James:** Don't thank me yet. Now, go!

(Hey, remember how I said "Don't worry about the details yet"? So, I don't think I'm going to write any more dialogue right now.)

### 3.1.5 Crossing the First Threshold
- Luke returns home to take a shower and tell his parents he's going on a quest.
- Luke's moms aren't super stoked about this, but hey! Their son is THE CHOSEN ONE! That's something to be proud of, right? Plus, who are they to interfere with fate?
- They give him some supplies, including THE NEEDLE.

## 3.2 Initiation
### 3.2.1 Tests, Allies, and Enemies
- Luke learns some spells
- James is pushing Luke really hard, and Luke's not doing that well with it because of Mana toxicity. (He'll just have to try harder.) He perseveres because he believes it's necessary to save ~~Sam~~ someone.
	- He might have a little bit of muscle memory for any spells that have somatic components.

### 3.2.2 The Approach
- Luke and Case set out to gather the Legendary Artifacts
- The first Artifact he gets is THE ORB, located in Rhapsody
	- Luke saves Case, but suffers from Mana toxicity
	- Case maybe doesn't know that Luke is suffering from Mana toxicity? (If he's also mostly learning from James, he might just think that's normal.)
- They also get THE BLADE and THE STAFF.

### 3.2.3 The Ordeal
- While attempting to retrieve THE CHALICE, Luke encounters AL for the "first" time. Despite James's "best" efforts, he is woefully unprepared, and AL beats him handily.
- Case, who is separated from Luke for some reason, shows up in the nick of time to save Luke, repaying him for saving his life in Rhapsody.
- Luke wonders why he lost if he's THE CHOSEN ONE. (He'll just have to try harder.) Case assures him that it's simply because he hasn't completed his training. (And maybe there's a sweet moment where Case promises that he'll never let Luke face AL alone again.)

### 3.2.4 Reward
- Luke returns to finish his training. James teaches him a very powerful spell, but Luke accidentally kills James when he tries to cast it. Maybe Luke has some more déjà vu about this, but it's too little, too late.
- As he dies, James begrudgingly admits that he is proud of Luke, and that he has a message for Luke to deliver to AL when next they meet: James still remembers AL.
	- In light of the "prophecy", what does this even mean? Case and Luke might have a discussion about this. (Case: I *knew* the AL from the prophecy was his ex!)

## 3.3 Return
### 3.3.1 The Road Back
- Luke and Case make their way to CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN.
	- Even if collecting The Artifacts was easy, this is going to be a challenge.
- With the spell and the message, Luke should be able to defeat AL.

### 3.3.2 The Resurrection
- Despite this, AL is *still* able to defeat them easily. (He'll just have to try harder.)
- Case sacrifices himself to save Luke.
- Just as AL is preparing to cast Reverse Fate, Luke cries out for him to wait. He has a message from James.
- AL casts Reverse Fate anyway. The timeline resets.

### 3.3.3 The Return
![[not this time.gif]]

## 3.4 Lessons Learned
- Edna is maybe not evil.
- Sam has been erased from existence.
	- Wait, how does he find this out? No one explicitly tells him this. I guess he just infers it from 1) Sam not being part of the [[BFS 10000]] and 2) nobody else remembering Sam?
- Case dies. (~~Skill issue, tbh.~~ Luke will just have to try harder.)

# 4 Fourth Loop
## 4.1 Departure
### 4.1.1 Ordinary World
- Still a time loop. Still the same.
### 4.1.2 Call to Adventure
- He'll be going to the Renaissance Faire this weekend, but he knows Sam won't be there. He goes anyway.
	- Maybe he can stop the other fairgoers from attacking the dragon? (He can't.)
- He sees Case. Case is alive! Maybe it was all just a bad dream, then.
	- Case has no idea who the boy currently hugging him to death is. (Case: This is kinda nice, though. I've never had someone this happy to see me, even though it's clearly a case of mistaken identity. Wait, what do you mean it's not?)
- Luke brings Case up to speed (at least, to Luke's understanding of events):
	- There's someone who used to be in his life who's missing; he thinks they were his partner. No one else seems to remember them. He's convinced they were real, however. He's not sure why, but he also knows they had some connection to the Renaissance Faire.
	- He knew Edna was going to be at the Faire, but he also knew they weren't actually a threat. (Perhaps Case also notices that Edna wasn't really attacking anyone.)
	- Luke realizes he's never met Case, but he feels like he knows him all the same. He tells Case about the dream he had the night before, in which Case is killed by an evil wizard named CURSED AL. (Case: That name sounds familiar, actually. Maybe we should talk to James about this.)
### 4.1.3 Refusal of the Call
- James tells Luke that he is THE CHOSEN ONE.
- How can he be THE CHOSEN ONE if he keeps losing to AL? He doesn't even know magic! (insert Shrek meme)
	- James: Skill issue. Git gud, scrub.
	- Luke: K 

### 4.1.4 Meeting with the Mentor
- James agrees to teach Luke magic. Case can learn, too.

### 4.1.5 Crossing the First Threshold
- Luke returns home to take a shower and tell his parents he's going on a quest.
- Luke's moms aren't super stoked about this, but hey! Their son is THE CHOSEN ONE! That's something to be proud of, right? Plus, who are they to interfere with fate?
- They give him some supplies, including THE NEEDLE.

## 4.2 Initiation
### 4.2.1 Tests, Allies, and Enemies
- Same as it ever was.

### 4.2.2 The Approach
- Same as it ever was.
- Wait, maybe Luke remembers the security system in Rhapsody, and they avoid setting it off this time.
	- Luke doesn't get to save Case, then.
		- But it's not like Case saves him from AL just because he's "returning the favor". He does genuinely care about Luke. (He may *act* like he's just returning the favor on the previous timelines, but that's just his Cool Guy façade.)
	- But, he also doesn't go through Mana toxicity.
	- If it's still like [[1.4 The Crossing of the First Threshold]], does this mean Luke foregoes the [[Chocolate Orange]]? (Maybe he's shifting into Serious Mode.)
- Other than that, same as it ever was.
### 4.2.3 The Ordeal


### 4.2.4 Reward


## 4.3 Return
### 4.3.1 The Road Back


### 4.3.2 The Resurrection


### 4.3.3 The Return


## 4.4 Lessons Learned
- Luke is experiencing a time loop.
- Case is still going to die. It wasn't a dream after all. 
	- Luke will just have to try harder.
	- How much harder? He's not sure he can take much more.
- James is a bastard man.

- Luke is THE CHOSEN ONE.

# 6 Sixth Loop (The One Without Case)
## 6.1 Departure
### 6.1.1 Ordinary World
- Luke lives a boring life in a boring town called Genton. At least, it *was* boring until his partner, Sam, was wiped from existence. Now he actively wishes it was still boring. He's tired of this shit, man. He just wants it to be over. But he doesn't know how to do that yet. (He'll just have to try harder.)

### 6.1.2 Call to Adventure
- Luke knows Sam isn't going to be at the Renaissance Faire.
- But he also knows Edna is going to "attack". He goes anyway.
	- What does he do? Does he try to warn people? Would anyone believe him?
	- Perhaps he finally notices that Edna seems particularly interested in Pauline...
- He sees Case, or perhaps Case sees him. The memories of Case's deaths (plural) make Luke feel sick, but he holds back. He doesn't want Case to get involved this time.
- Case observes Luke's composure during the dragon attack and finds it suspicious (but also kinda attractive?). It's almost like Luke knew this was coming...
	- "Wow, you were pretty brave out there. Most people would have panicked during a dragon attack, as you can tell, but you didn't."
	- (visibly distressed) "Oh. I'm... not brave. Like, at all. Please leave me alone. I can't bear to watch you die again."
- This obviously weirds Case the fuck out. He reports it to James, who wants to meet Luke.

### 6.1.3 Refusal of the Case
- James prepares to go out and find Luke, but Luke is already outside his door. He announces that he knows he is THE CHOSEN ONE and that he's experiencing a time loop. He doesn't know how to fix it, but he knows James can help.
- James concurs and agrees to teach Luke the magic that Luke already kinda knows. He'll also send Case along to help Luke on his quest.
- Luke objects to this. Maybe he argues that Case was with him on all the previous timelines, and they still lost, so he wants to try something different. (Too smart?) Or maybe he's just forthright and says he's tired of watching Case die.
- James disagrees (he knows Case was sent by [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]]), but he is unable to convince Luke. Luke will have to learn the hard way that this is a bad plan.

### 6.1.4 Meeting with the Mentor
- Combined with above.

### 6.1.5 Crossing the First Threshold
- By this point, Luke probably knows to tell his mothers in advance, so he already has the supplies, including THE NEEDLE. He'll start training with James first thing in the morning.

## 6.2 Initiation
### 6.2.1 Tests, Allies, and Enemies
- James is still kind of a dick, even though Luke has more experience this time around.
	- "Oh, wow. Your form was almost perfect. Perfectly wrong! Do it again, but do it right."
	- He'll just have to try harder.
- Maybe James makes Luke train with Case anyway, hoping Luke changes his mind.
	- See what I wrote in the "Case File (get it?)" thread on Discord, but maybe Case is ostensibly there to learn magic from James, and IMAS is just using him as a way to keep tabs on James.
	- And maybe he's also trying to set them up a little? Not that James actually cares—he just wants Case gone—but if Case is going to show up later anyway during [[Outline#3.2.3 The Ordeal|The Ordeal]], then it would probably make more sense if he at least knew Luke a little better.
		- Luke would probably have a hard time opening up, though.

### 6.2.2 The Approach
- This isn't fun anymore without Case. Luke doesn't even care about the [[Chocolate Orange]] in Rhapsody.
	- He's not eating much at all, lately. And he hasn't been sleeping well, either. He's constantly on edge. How can he sleep when the world is counting on him? When Sam is counting on him? When every time he sleeps, he sees his failure at the end of each loop? When every time he closes his eyes, the air fills with the scent of iron? ~~Case screams~~ he couldn't make a sound. ~~Luke runs towards him~~ he couldn't move. ~~It lasts an eternity~~ it was over in a minute. But it never really ends, does it? In his dreams and in his life. ~~It would be better to just die.~~ Some CHOSEN ONE he is. ~~It would be better to just die.~~ He has to keep going regardless. He'll just have to try harder. ~~Can he try any harder?~~
	- Since the playfighting with Case was what triggered the security system in the previous timelines (see [[1.4 The Crossing of the First Threshold]]), maybe that doesn't happen this time.
	- Probably a good thing. In the state that he's in, Mana Toxicity would be way worse than usual.
- He also gets THE BLADE and THE STAFF.
	- Even though it's mostly as easy as before, Luke finds it more difficult than ever. Too many memories with Case along the way, especially when it comes to THE STAFF. (Also, it probably is at least slightly harder even without that. Luke has more experience, but now he's by himself.)

### 6.2.3 The Ordeal
- Despite being in a constant state of hypervigilance, AL still catches Luke by surprise while he's attempting to retrieve THE CHALICE.
- Luke tries to defend himself, but, as stated above, his Mana tolerance is kinda fucked.
- Again, Luke wonders what kind of CHOSEN ONE he must be if he can be beaten so easily. (He'll just have to try harder.)
- Then this happens: 
![[queen of england.jpeg]] 
- Maybe Case shows up anyway because he's discovered TEH DARK TRUTH \[sic\] about James
	- Luke is obviously going to have some very mixed feelings about seeing Case right now.

### 6.2.4 Reward
- Luke accidentally(?) kills James. Again, with the whole PTSD thing Luke has going on, he's going to have some major side effects from casting the powerful spell James teaches him. (By this point, he has built up some tolerance, but it's still going to hit harder than normal.)
	- At some point, I should probably decide what this spell is
- James wants Luke to deliver his message to AL
- Maybe Luke has another existential crisis about what a bad CHOSEN ONE he is since he doesn't feel bad enough about killing James. (He'll just have to try harder?)

## 6.3 Return
### 6.3.1 The Road Back
- This is the place.
- This is where it happens.
- What am I doing here?
- I can't be here!
- Holy fuck, I have to leave!
- Why did I come here?
- I can't breathe!
- I need out of here!
![[mr bones wild ride.jpg]]
- He can't try any harder.
- He can't do it alone.

### 6.3.2 The Resurrection
- AL casts Reverse Fate, uninterrupted by Luke or Case.
- The timeline resets.

### 6.3.3 The Return
