Note to self: Just an outline, okay? Don't worry about the details yet. That comes later.

# First Loop
## Departure
### Ordinary World
- [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] lives a boring life in a boring town called [[Genton]]. We've been over this many times already. Nothing new here.

### Call to Adventure
- [[Sam Ward|Sam]] disappears. Luke goes looking for them in [[Plata]].
- [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|Edna]] attacks.
- Luke is introduced to [[James Redawić|James]] and [[Case Weston|Case]]. Luke learns Sam has been kidnapped by [[CURSED AL]].
- James tells Luke that he is THE CHOSEN ONE or some bullshit.

### Refusal of the Call
- It's not that Luke doesn't want to be THE CHOSEN ONE. He wants to save Sam, of course. But is he really the right person for the job? He's only 16. He was terrified when Edna attacked. And he doesn't know magic.
	- I'm kinda worried that this could be at odds with Luke's defining personality traits: being an idiot and being in love with Sam. I guess we need to make sure that we frame it more as a matter of self-doubt.

### Meeting with the Mentor
- James reluctantly agrees to teach Luke the magic he needs to know. He'll also send Case along with him.
- Luke reluctantly agrees to be taught.

### Crossing the First Threshold
- Luke returns home to tell [[The Mothers Campbell|his moms]] he is leaving to save Sam. They are, quite reasonably, not very enthusiastic about this, largely for the same reasons as Luke.
	- Luke's like, "I'm not happy about this, either, but I have to do it. I'm THE CHOSEN ONE."
	- One of his mothers (probably [[Elizabeth Campbell|Elizabeth]], since she's supposed to be the smart one) asks if he's sure James is right about him being THE CHOSEN ONE.
	- Case assures her that James is himself a powerful wizard and probably knows what he's talking about. (Case is there because he drove Luke home from Plata.)
- Luke's mothers relent and decide to let him go. They know he would go anyway. They give him some supplies to get him ready for his journey.
	- Maybe among the supplies is [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]]?

## Initiation
### Tests, Allies, and Enemies
- Luke learns some spells
- James is pushing Luke really hard, and Luke's not doing that well with it. He perseveres because he believes it's necessary to save Sam.

### The Approach/Approach to the Inmost Cave
- Luke and Case set out to gather the [[Legendary Artifacts]]
- The first Artifact he gets is [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]], located in [[Rhapsody]]
	- Amazingly, the warehouse where it's kept is not very closely guarded. Seems like a pretty easy mission...
	- ...Until they accidentally trigger the security systems
	- Luke has been struggling a lot with his lessons and continues to doubt whether he truly is THE CHOSEN ONE, but he manages to cast a powerful spell, saving Case from a close call
	- It's not a spell Luke should know. It's way above his level, and he gets some pretty bad [[Mana#Mana Toxicity|Mana toxicity]] symptoms. But, it's a good boost to his confidence. (I'm also going to say right now that the more severe symptoms don't always kick in right away. They have enough time to get out of the warehouse, and maybe they'll even be partway back to Plata before Luke really begins to feel it. And, of course, this will happen less frequently as he builds tolerance.)
	- Case is surprised that Luke knew that spell but figures James's intense training must really be working. Though if/when he realizes that Luke is experiencing severe mana toxicity, he's going to be very pissed at James. (James: Well, he saved your life, didn't he? And he's still alive. I don't see what the problem is here.)
		- Luke would probably try to hide this from Case. Mix of animal instinct to hide pain, desire to look cool in front of Case, not wanting him to worry, and of course, denial.
- They also get [[BLADE OF POWER|THE BLADE]] and [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM|THE STAFF]]. (If Luke is already in possession of [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]], this means they now have 4 of the 7 Artifacts.)
	- What if all of them are actually pretty easy to get? Undermines James's insistence on intense training, which might actually be making things worse. (I want James to *feel* justified in mistreating Luke, but I don't want him to *be* justified.)
- AL already has [[CRYSTAL OF GRELLNATH|THE CRYSTAL]] since he needed it to summon [[Emperoress, The|The Emperoress]], and he may have one of the other Artifacts as well.

### The Ordeal
- While attempting to retrieve [[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH|THE CHALICE]], Luke encounters AL for the first time. Despite James's "best" efforts, he is woefully unprepared, and AL beats him handily.
- Case, who is separated from Luke for reasons yet to be determined, shows up in the nick of time to save Luke, repaying him for saving his life in Rhapsody.
- Luke wonders why he lost if he's THE CHOSEN ONE. Case assures him that it's simply because he hasn't completed his training. (And maybe there's a sweet moment where Case promises that he'll never let Luke face AL alone again.)
	- So maybe the timeline without Case is the one where AL tells Luke that James is just using him...

### Reward
- Luke returns to finish his training. James teaches him a very powerful spell, but Luke accidentally kills James when he tries to cast it.
- As he dies, James begrudgingly admits that he is proud of Luke, and that he has a message for Luke to deliver to AL when next they meet: James still remembers AL.

## Return
### The Road Back
- With the spell and the message, Luke should be able to defeat AL.
- Luke and Case make their way to [[CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN]].
- Even if collecting The Artifacts was easy, this is going to be a challenge.

### The Resurrection
- Despite this, AL is *still* able to defeat them easily.
- Case sacrifices himself to save Luke.
- Just as AL is preparing to cast [[Reverse Fate]], Luke cries out for him to wait. He has a message from James.
	- Lol, what if AL's reaction is just, "Yeah, I'd fucking hope he remembers me. We were married for like 200 years..."
- Regardless of AL's reaction, he's distracted long enough for Sam to do some shenanigans
- AL casts Reverse Fate, but instead of resurrecting James, it resets the timeline to the beginning of the story, except Sam no longer exists.

### The Return/Return with the Elixir
- Nope. Not on this timeline.

# Second Loop
## Departure
### Ordinary World
- Luke lives a boring life in a boring town called Genton. He can't help but feel that something is missing from his life, but what?

### Call to Adventure
- He'll be going to the [[Plata Fairgrounds|Renaissance Faire]] this weekend, but something feels off. For some reason, he feels compelled to go there early.
	- Maybe he had a dream about Sam the night before.
- When Edna attacks, Luke experiences déjà vu. He feels that he came here to look for someone.
	- Also, maybe he's a bit less frightened by the attack since it's happened before.
- He sees Case. Is this the person he's looking for? He looks familiar...
- The déjà vu intensifies. Luke freaks out. Case gets James to help.
	- Maybe Case senses that the déjà vu is magical in origin?

### Refusal of the Call
- James confirms that the déjà vu is real. (He's just bullshitting, but he happens to be right.) Luke really has done this before.
- Luke may question how good of a CHOSEN ONE he really is since he's apparently failed to break the time loop, but he ultimately resigns himself to his fate.

### Meeting with the Mentor
- James reluctantly agrees to teach Luke the magic he needs to know. He'll also send Case along with him.
- Luke reluctantly agrees to be taught.
