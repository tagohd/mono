A holiday celebrating the Summer Solstice (21 December). A time for grilling, hanging out with your friends by the pool, and watching the "fireworks" displays (actually just magic, so they aren't loud).

Not as major of a holiday as [[Winterday]], though still quite important. Businesses may have limited hours instead of closing entirely, for example.
