# Chapter 1
It was a quiet night in Genton, as most nights were. Little of note ever happened in the sleepy farming town, and, in truth, most of the residents seemed to prefer it that way. Those who preferred more excitement had either moved away or were stuck in the town out of obligation or necessity, typically by virtue of being a child who could not move out on their own. Luke Campbell was one of the latter such denizens, and did he ever wish he weren't.

To a boy like Luke, being in prison would almost have been preferable to living in Genton, if only for the sheer novelty of the experience. He knew there was a much larger world out there, and he dreamt of seeing it. The most he ever got to see was a handful of the surrounding small towns during the occasional track meet, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the other small towns near Genton were not all that different. Plata, at least, had the good fortune of being a ski resort, but that also meant it was quite expensive to live there. Furthermore, it, too, was not very exciting during the offseason.

Luke hated living in Genton, or Boringsville, as he liked to call it, but what was he to do? At 17, he was a ways off from being able to set out on his own. College? His grades were less than stellar, and his performance on the cross country team wasn't especially noteworthy. He performed satisfactorily, to be sure, but he certainly wasn't going to be getting any scholarships. Plus, the idea of four *more* years of school didn't particularly appeal to him. He seemed to lack the natural aptitude to make a good apprentice mage, and there weren't many other jobs that *did* interest him. So, he had resigned himself to taking over the family farm and living in Boringsville the rest of his life.

\[^ Should probably put that somewhere else. Weren't we going to start at the Faire, anyway?]

But, quiet nights must eventually give way to quiet mornings. The sun slowly filtered in through the windows and onto Luke's sleeping face. As he awoke, he noticed the conspicuously empty bed beside his, along with a phone that had been left behind. After checking the bathroom and downstairs, Luke concluded that his twin, Sam, was not at home.

\[If Sam doesn't exist, then who was phone? Maybe it will turn out to actually have been Luke's phone the whole time... (I just needed an excuse for Sam to be incommunicado.)]

It was unlike Sam to leave without him, but maybe they were just eager to get to the Renaissance Faire in Plata, which was beginning today. It was, after all, very like Sam to act on impulse. So, Luke decided he would start his search there. He needed to be there anyway; he was one of the jousters. He saddled up his horse, Pauline, and took off for the Faire.

As he approached the fairgrounds, screams and smoke both rose in the distance. An enormous shadow passed overhead, and Luke looked up to see the scaled belly of a giant dragon. "Wow," he thought, "they really went all out on the effects this year. An illusion that believable would need a really skilled wizard to cast."

But he quickly realized the panic and chaos were genuine; this was no illusion, but an actual, honest to god dragon. His heart fell to his stomach as he realized Sam might be in serious danger. He urged his horse onward into the pandemonium, hoping to spot any sign of them.

Suddenly, the dragon swooped down towards him, letting out a piercing screech. The wind from its wings pushed him low into his saddle, and Pauline began bucking. The dragon made a second dive—it seemed to be after him in particular! Pauline threw Luke from her back, and he landed facedown in the mud. He was in real trouble now; if he didn't get up quickly, he could soon be trampled by the fleeing crowd.

Then, the air went still, and everything was quiet. A feeling of weightlessness overtook him, and it seemed as though he was floating. "Oh, gods, I'm dead, aren't I?" he thought. "This is my spirit being carried off to the afterlife." But as he drifted over the stampede, he was unable to see his own body. Shouldn't it still be there?

He didn't have much time to consider this, however, for as suddenly as it appeared, the bubble around him had burst. Luke's ears popped as the air rushed back in around him, and he was unceremoniously dumped back into the mud, though safely away from the crowd. He caught his breath and found himself at the feet of a young man about his age.

"I—I'm not dead?" he asked.

"Nope, not yet," the boy replied. "You're welcome, by the way," he added, as though he hadn't just dropped Luke into the mud.

"So you're the one who blew that bubble?"

While not inaccurate, he wasn't entirely pleased with that description. He hesitated briefly before saying, "I suppose you could say that, though I prefer to think of it more as casting Sphere of Protection."
