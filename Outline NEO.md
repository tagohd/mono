Okay, a more "official" one this time. Let's try and focus only on what's actually going to be shown.
# 1 First Loop
## 1.1 Chapter 1
- We start at the [[Plata Fairgrounds|Renaissance Faire]]. We establish that [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] is looking for [[Sam Ward|Sam]]. Initially, you might think they got separated while at the Faire, but actually, Sam has been missing since this morning.
	- It's the Friday before spring break, and Sam has never been to the Faire before, so maybe Luke thinks they cut class to go early.
