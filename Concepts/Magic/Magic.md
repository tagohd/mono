Wouldn't be much of an RPG without spells, would it?

Had an idea for a magic system I thought was kind of cool, so I'm just going to suggest that here:

You know how in a lot of magic systems you have some sort of magical energy (let's call it [[Mana]]) flowing around freely in the air? It starts from the same concept, but it's separated from the physical plane and just kind of chilling in [[Mana Plane|its own plane]] superimposed on our plane. 
So if you want to cast a spell, you need to get some mana from the mana-plane into the physical plane. Casters can do this by pretty literally poking a hole in the veil between the two planes, causing mana to flow into this one. And then they can use this mana to cast whatever spell they want! 
So in this system, what limits a caster from casting infinite powerful spells is not their own magical energy that has to recharge but rather the need to make sure that there isn't too much mana flowing into the physical realm. Imagine you're a mage and you want to cast [[Super Meteor of Major Fucking Mayhem]]. You could perfectly poke a big enough hole in the plane veil to get enough mana to cast that, no problem. Whether you can control that amount of mana and form it into the spell you want is up to how good you are, but let's assume you got that down - you can cast your spell! However, after you had your fun blasting whatever into oblivion, you may now notice that there is still a gaping hole in the plane veil spouting mana into this realm. This is a problem because mana is essentially pure, unstable energy and now you and everything within a few miles radius around you is going to go boom! Or, regarding the chaotic nature of mana, maybe something even worse! 
This is why, in order to not have a boatload of Boom Juice seeping freely into our world, casters not only need to be able to poke a hole into the veil and be able to control the mana coming out, they also need to be able to stitch the hole they just poked back up, and that while controlling all mana coming out. Luckily for casters, the veil between planes starts closing from itself as soon as a hole has been poked through, so for small holes you don't need any stitching and for larger holes stitching it a bit roughly is good enough.

This system has some of the following practical consequences:
- You can cast as many spells as you want as long as they're cast in different locations! (Assuming you can and do patch the veil for all of them)
	- This encourages the player to move around the screen a lot, and even going to places you typically don't want to be (e.g. dangerously close to a boss) because you can still cast a spell there
- Spells weak enough that they can't damage the veil to the point of free mana spills are commonly taught to people, even non-mages, since they're both easy to cast and safe.
	-  (Mini-)Bosses could have some fun magic moves despite them being non-casters (rogues going invisible or a small speed-boost or something)
- Powerful spells have longer casting times because it includes patching the veil. You can also choose not to do that last step for faster casting, but that will have major repercussions. This goes the same for casting spells above your magical level, for which you can't patch the veil quickly enough. Or casting a spell in an area where the veil was still recovering.
	- Free mana could convert into various magical effects, like huge screen-wide AoE explosions (can also be used to kill enemies in a pinch if you can tank the hit!), time speeding up or slowing down in an area, matter coming into or out of existence, magical barriers forming (potentially trapping the player with a bunch of monsters hehe), etc.
		- Perhaps enough free mana could cause such pronounced, long-lasting (permanent?) effects on the caster that one might consider them to be CURSED... (cough cough [[CURSED AL]])

Involves the [[SOUL]] somehow, hence the desire for the [[BFS 10000]]. (Since I have yet to define what the SOUL is, maybe it doesn't make sense to amplify them; I might have to change the name later.) But maybe the SOUL acts like a lightning rod for mana, or the SOUL itself is the one doing the amplification. Maybe mana comes in a variety of wavelengths and each SOUL has a specific "resonant frequency", so to speak. If you want to cast a [[Shield (Spell)|protection spell]], you channel green mana; if you want to cast [[Magic Missile]], you channel yellow mana; etc.

(Did you know imgflip lets you upload your own fonts?)

[Lun]: I didn't! Very cool!
[Sudo]: I don't know if you caught this, but the other joke is that "MONO" is written in the Omori font. Surprisingly, I haven't plagiarized much from Omori yet.


This isn't to say that only certain people can cast certain spells. It's just that certain spells come easier to you if your SOUL is the right "color". ^03cfb6

[Lun]: I like the Mana-SOUL connection, but maybe this is just a bit too much uhhh "borrowing" from undertale? Maybe people can train their SOUL to better resonate with certain mana (which would translate to like leveling a skill tree in game) rather than it being a born trait? Or maybe it doesn't work like an amplifier at all, but instead works like kind of a Mana-container you can fill by poking rifts between the realms and thereafter use it to cast a spell? In which case it functions like kind of a classic Mana-bar, except that you charge it by poking holes in the veil between dimensions and that you have to immediately use all of the Mana you stored to cast a spell because storing pure, highly unstable energy in your body for a maintained duration is not the safest thing to do. So in essence it functions like a sort of Mana-stabilizer and converter.

[Sudo]: Oh, so we're just gonna steal from Hollow Knight instead? SOUL Vessels? (And you poke rifts between planes by attacking enemies?) But, yeah, whenever I suggest something that's just "blatant plagiarism of Undertale", I'm mostly joking. Mostly. (But really, it's more like a placeholder until I come up with something that's less "blatant plagiarism of Undertale".)

[Sudo]: Oh! Maybe the "color" of your SOUL determines your spellcasting ability? Even though everyone is casting magic in the same fundamental way (channeling Mana from the Mana Plane, as opposed to, e.g., calling on the power of a god), maybe they manipulate the Mana in different ways depending on their spellcasting ability.
#Gameplay ?

gameplay:: "SOUL color determines spellcasting ability or vice versa. This seems unlikely to be implemented since we haven't decided that spellcasting abilities differ across mages. Furthermore, Luke's ability scores will probably be predetermined. Further-furthermore, will the SOUL even be shown?", "If the SOUL *is* shown, maybe there's a small chance that it's a different color than normal. Kinda like a FUN value event. Like, if your FUN value is 6, your SOUL is green, but for all other values, it's red. ([[Magic#^03cfb6|ref]])"

# Fuckin' Magic, How Does It Work?
## Can vs. Should

>[!idea] Anyone *can* use magic, but few know it even exists
>Maybe magic was only recently discovered, given that it exists on [[Mana Plane|a separate plane of reality]]. Or perhaps magic users try to keep its existence a secret because of how dangerous it is. You know, the whole "tearing apart the fabric of reality" thing.

>[!question] Lun: Doesn't "magic was only recently discovered" kind of clash with the idea of AL being an ancient magician? It also limits how many enemies/bosses can logically have cool magic attacks.
>Magic being kept a secret also sounds pretty disruptive to the story, every time someone new saw Luke casting magic you'd need to have a whole "what the FUCK did you just do" dialogue.
>I'm more a fan of the whole "it's not commonly taught to everyone because you can accidentally nuke your current location"-idea. 

[Sudo]: Maybe it's recent in the sense that oil is recent. It's always been around, and there have been limited uses for it (e.g. pitch), but it didn't really take off until the last century. But that's a good point about it being secret. Might have to scratch that idea. (Hmmm, in that case maybe [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] should actually have a little more authority.)
[Sudo]: I am pretty attached to the whole "can vs. should" thing, though. But, yeah, maybe it's just not something most people even need to learn. Oh! Maybe electricity is a better analogy than oil. Everyone uses electricity in their day-to-day life, but you don't necessarily need to understand it to make use of it. It's also not that hard to start doing little projects with it, but you're not going to be, like, rewiring your whole house or designing a computer chip without a lot of specialized training. And it can easily kill you if you don't know what you're doing. And, again, widespread but relatively recent in the grand scheme of things.
[Sudo]: Also like electricity, anyone *can* learn to use magic, but a lot of people don't see the need.

%%
sudoMajor:: Okay, maybe magic is "recent" in the sense that electricity is recent. But you're right, it shouldn't be secret. And also a lot of people don't really have a need for, e.g. Maxwell's equations in their daily life.

>Spells weak enough that they can't damage the veil to the point of free mana spills are commonly taught to people, even non-mages, since they're both easy to cast and safe.

Maybe people aren't even aware that this is magic. It's just... a thing that you can do.

Furthermore, magic is kind of a last resort. Again, because of how dangerous it can be, even the most skilled users try to limit how often they use it.

Maybe there are some in-game consequences, too. You've played OneShot, right? Maybe if you use magic too much, you can see it start to corrupt reality; weird glitchy things start showing up, and maybe certain areas become inaccessible. (Probably nothing that would soft-lock you unless you're *really* overusing it.) But it starts out subtle—most players might not even notice it—then ramps up the more you use it.
^magic-not-even-once

[Lun]: Hmmm, the way I thought of it magic is pretty much completely safe to use if you know what you're doing (and don't intentionally go horse crazy with it). I do like the idea of the world getting corrupted though, OneShot good game. Maybe that could be an effect of free Mana instead (in addition to the immediate random effects it has)?

[Sudo]: Okay, maybe it's not a "last resort" then. But maybe it's more like Warp in Star Trek. They could all be going Warp 9 if they wanted to (and if their warp engines were capable of it), but they collectively agreed to not go over Warp 5(?) because it turned out it was literally tearing apart the universe or something like that. (It's TNG S7E9, if you're interested. And then they kinda just forgot about it in later episodes lol.) #Cite/TV/Star-Trek-TNG [tvRefType: Star Trek TNG/General]
[Sudo]: On second thought, maybe not. But even if it's not a last resort, it might not be a first resort either. Perhaps there just aren't that many practical spells. Or using magic is kind of a pain in the ass. Or a pain in the SOUL? (Haha, there's an idea: maybe some people don't like magic because they think it's like the SOUL-equivalent of smoking cigarettes. It's not actually, but that doesn't stop people from believing it.)

%%
sudoMajor:: Perhaps there's some sort of in-universe disincentive to using magic? Beyond the risk of universal destruction, that is. Like, it's kinda hard or it's not that useful most of the time?
%%

Probably wouldn't be as fourth-wall-breaking as OneShot, but it could still be a little meta. Maybe characters don't comment on it at first, so you think it really was just a glitch, but as it progresses, they'll be like, "Hey, this has been going for a while, hasn't it? I just didn't say anything at first because I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me," revealing that it's been diegetic the whole time.

%%

gameRefType:: OneShot/General

Wouldn't that be something? A game that punishes you for using its magic system... Maybe it only does this if you forget to close the rift or something. But maybe the game doesn't actively remind you to close the rifts; you have to keep on top of that yourself. And, of course, maybe there are occasionally incentives to **_not_** close the rifts. #Gameplay 

gameplay:: Diegetic glitches resulting from forgetting to seal rifts after casting spells. Otherwise being punished for using magic. Possible incentives for NOT closing rifts. ([[Magic#^magic-not-even-once|ref]])

Also, something something Law of Equivalent Exchange.

## Questions
>[!question] Collective term for magic users? Magic users? Magicians? Wizards? Sorcerers? Mages? Warlocks? Witches?
>Any. They're interchangeable. Some people may prefer one to the others, though.

>[!question] Do they use names based on the kind of magic they specialize in, e.g. Illusionists, Artificers, Necromancers, etc.?
>They can. Again, it mostly comes down to personal preference.

>[!question] Are there distinctions between magic users? Is a wizard different from a sorcerer different from a warlock? (Like D&D)
>Maybe in the sense of how they approach magic/level of formal training? But, on a fundamental level, everyone uses magic the same way.

>[!question] Are there clerics and/or paladins? Are there gods at all?
>No. Or, at least, they're not relevant to the practice of magic.

>[!question] Is there some kind of governing body overseeing the use of magic? A council of wizards or something?
>It's more like [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|a professional association]], like IEEE. They issue best practices and fund research into new [[List of Spells|spells]] and whatnot, but they can't, like, prevent anyone from using magic. They are fairly influential in the world of magic, though (and relatively unheard of outside of it.)

>[!question] But magic is dangerous. Surely there most be some official regulations or something.
>Governments don't want to officially acknowledge the existence of magic, so they leave that up to IMAS. Any crime committed via magical means is prosecuted normally.
>
>Governments are aware of magic, of course. It's just classified. (This undoubtedly leads to quite a few conspiracy theories.)

[Lun]: You really want magic to be classified huh. Fine, fine! Baka...

sudoMajor:: Oh, that's old, actually. I just haven't updated it with the newer ideas in [[(Talk) James Redawić]], i.e. magic not being a secret and being more like electricity.

## WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!
### More effective than placebo, at least
>[!question] If James is paraplegic, why doesn't he just magically cure himself?
>There's only so much you can do with healing magic.

[Lun]: Also, relating what you wrote above: consider that magic might not be able to do _everything_. How I see it, [[Mana]] is really just a funky energy source which you can use to do a bunch of different things. However, most of it is pretty elementary (move stuff, ignite stuff, zap stuff, create simple stuff) whereas something like healing is very much not an elementary thing to do. That would require almost complete biological knowledge on what you want to heal + even if you know what to do, the healing itself would be extremely difficult too, like curing paralysis would probably involve stitching neurons back together.

[Sudo]:  Yeah, that's a good way of looking at it too. Basically my first response: Magic doesn't work that way. 
[Sudo]: Oh, wait, I realized another problem.

>[!question] Don't most games have healing spells? Or at least some way to restore HP (whatever that is)?
>Maybe MONO is a rouge-like? Perhaps you slowly heal over time (but if you take enough damage, maybe you never really heal fully, just like real life), and if you die, you're perma-dead (also just like real life).
>
>>[!note] Of course, the main thing with video games is that very often fun trumps realism. Verisimilitude doesn't matter if the game isn't fun.
>
>Or maybe healing spells don't really "heal" you. They're more like first aid. They might stop bleeding and let you ignore the pain, but you're still technically injured. ^first-aid

And of course, HP is just an abstraction of your ability to keep going in a fight. What it's actually analogous to might not really matter.

[Lun]: Alright, add "Conjure band-aid" to the spell list. Also maybe you can speed up time to accelerate natural healing (which would not work for curing paralysis or let's say losing a limb)? I guess in this game you just have to go visit an actual-to god doctor when you take too much damage. Kind of like the Pokecenters in pokemon, except that its a peoplecenter and you are the people.

[Sudo]: Done. See: [[Cure Wounds]] and [[Regenerate]]

[Lun]: Oh, you're ACTUALLY putting in DnD spells huh
#Gameplay 

gameplay:: You can heal yourself, but only to an extent. If you get hurt too badly, you need to see a doctor. ([[Magic#^first-aid|ref]])

### You can't teleport, but you CAN wavedash
>[!question] If James is a paraplegic wizard, can't he just, like, fly and teleport and stuff?
>Let's just stick with "Magic doesn't work that way." [[Teleport|Teleportation]] just isn't a spell that exists. The best you can do is [[Evasion|teleport short distances]], kinda like a dash ability. [[Plane Shift]] and [[Astral Projection]] are different.
