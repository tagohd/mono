# About
It's kinda like The Force, except somehow way nerdier. And no midichlorians. Wait. Music pun. Uh... MIDIdorians. It has MIDIdorians instead. #Cite/Movie/Star-Wars [movieRefType:: Star Wars/Concepts]

It exists in a separate plane to reality. [[Magic]] users pierce the veil between planes to access mana, and then focus the mana with their [[SOUL|SOULS]] in order to cast spells. Comes from the [[Mana Plane]].

# Exposure to Mana
To the inexperienced, bringing Mana into your SOUL can be rather uncomfortable. First-time mages often report an experience similar to an electrical shock. Muscle cramps, tremors, and vomiting are common reactions. However, one can build up one's tolerance of Mana.

Chinwe Ejiofor was a prominent researcher into the effects of Mana on living tissue, and her work was foundational to SOUL fusion research, such as Project Dorian. The Ejiofor (symbol: Ej), the unit of Mana concentration, was named in her honor.

## Mana Toxicity
The average person can tolerate around 50 Ej of Mana without significant reaction.
