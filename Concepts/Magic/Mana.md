# About
It's kinda like The Force, except somehow way nerdier. And no midichlorians. Wait. Music pun. Uh... MIDIdorians. It has MIDIdorians instead. #Cite/Movie/Star-Wars [movieRefType:: Star Wars/Concepts]

It exists in a separate plane to reality. [[Magic]] users pierce the veil between planes to access mana, and then focus the mana with their [[SOUL|SOULS]] in order to cast spells. Comes from the [[Mana Plane]].

# Exposure to Mana
To the inexperienced, bringing Mana into your SOUL can be rather uncomfortable. First-time mages often report an experience similar to an electrical shock. Muscle cramps, tremors, and vomiting are common reactions. However, one can build up one's tolerance of Mana.

Chinwe Ejiofor was a prominent researcher into the effects of Mana on living tissue, and her work was foundational to SOUL fusion research, such as Project Dorian. The Ejiofor (symbol: Ej), the unit of Mana concentration, was named in her honor.

## Mana Toxicity
The average person can tolerate around 150 Ej of Mana without significant reaction.

| Spell Level      | Mana Cost      | Typical Symptoms (experienced by >50% of novices)                              |
|------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 (Cantrip)      | <157.58 Ej     | Slight tingling sensation in extremities, metallic taste in mouth              |
| 1 (Minor)        | >3.17 KEj      | Slight headache, nausea, cramps, fatigue                                       |
| 2 (Minor)        | >63.57 KEj     | Burns at exposure site, visual hallucinations, mild fever, vomiting            |
| 3 (Minor)        | >1.28 MEj      | Loss of appetite, aphasia, tremors, emotional lability                         |
| 4 (Intermediate) | >25.65 MEj     | Body-wide pain, incontinence, auditory hallucinations                          |
| 5 (Intermediate) | >515.14 MEj    | Overwhelming sense of guilt, high fever, moderate diarrhea and vomiting        |
| 6 (Intermediate) | >10.35 GEj     | Shock, numbness of the extremities, loss of muscle tone, purpura               |
| 7 (Major)        | >207.82 GEj    | Hypotension, paralysis, temporary blindness, sense of impending doom, death    |
| 8 (Major)        | >4.17 TEj      | Severe diarrhea and vomiting, seizures, uncontrollable crying                  |
| 9 (Major)        | >83.84 TEj     | A feeling of euphoria, followed shortly by an extremely agonizing death (100%) |

Mana Cost for a spell can be calculated according to the following formula: $$\frac{e^{3l}}{E}*1000$$
where $e$ is Euler's number, $l$ is the Spell Level, and $E$ is Ejiofor's constant, 6.3459269958.

In universe, this is probably calculated the other way around, i.e. spell level is derived from mana cost.

Of course, as tolerance builds, a mage will experience fewer of these symptoms. For instance, a mage accustomed to casting Level 5 spells who attempts to cast a Level 7 spell may have a similar experience to a complete novice attempting to cast a Level 2 spell.
