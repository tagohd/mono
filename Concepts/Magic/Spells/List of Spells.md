The stronger the spell, the more [[Mana]] required, and thus larger tears in the veil separating reality from the [[Mana Plane]].

# Cantrips
These are spells that anyone can cast as they deal minimal damage to the veil between planes. Most people aren't even aware that they're magic.

# Minor Spells
Commonly taught to beginner mages, but slightly more powerful than cantrips.

# Intermediate Spells
Difficult to handle, but more powerful.

# Major Spells
Extremely dangerous. Only skilled mages should attempt to cast these spells.

# Forbidden Spells
Spells [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] has forbidden for any number of reasons. May include spells of any level.

# Theoretical Spells
No one has ever attempted to cast these, but they may be possible under the right circumstances. Even so, IMAS may forbid its members from researching these spells.
