*7th-level transmutation*

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Touch
- Materials: A prayer wheel and holy water
	- That's what D&D says, but I'm going to say it requires something different
- Duration: 1 hour

You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. (Immediately?) For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).

~~The target's severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.~~
