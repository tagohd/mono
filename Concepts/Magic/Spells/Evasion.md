*4th-level transmutation*

- Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack
- Range: Self
- Materials: N/A
- Duration: 1 round

>[!note]
>This is a modified version of Blink. It is one level higher mostly because there currently aren't any intermediate spells.

You vanish instantly, traversing through the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on the Ethereal Plane). Until your next turn, any attacks targeting you automatically miss. On your next turn, you reappear at any unoccupied point within a 10-foot sphere. You cannot reappear inside the ground or a wall, but you can reappear in the airâ€”you may take fall damage, however.
