- Duration: Instantaneous.

>[!note]
>"Realistically", this would probably more like a combination of several spells than one single spell. But I don't want to figure out which ones right now, so the actual spell is just "Legendary Artifact + Thermite" for now. (You can try this spell at home with your own Legendary Artifacts!)

Allows the user to permanently destroy any Legendary Artifact.

**WARNING:** [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] strongly encourages its members to refrain from destroying any Legendary Artifacts. Instead, please between them to your local IMAS hall so they can be studied.

>[!idea]
>Maybe [[CURSED AL]] is using IMAS to collect the Artifacts for him.

>[!question] But doesn't he hate IMAS? Or is blacklisted by them?
>Ah, see, it's the perfect cover! No one would ever believe he was behind it all. Or maybe it's how [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]] is manipulating [[Luke Campbell|Luke]]. "You see, young one, it is an ancient rite of passage for wizards to collect the Seven Legendary Artifacts before being granted admission to IMAS. It's like a snipe hunt but for mages."
