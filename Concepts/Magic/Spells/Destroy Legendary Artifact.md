*7th-level transmutation*

- Casting Time: 1 hour
- Range: Touch

- Duration: Instantaneous.

>[!note]
>"Realistically", this would probably more like a combination of several spells than one single spell. But I don't want to figure out which ones right now, so the actual spell is just "Legendary Artifact + Thermite" for now. (You can try this spell at home with your own Legendary Artifacts!)

Allows the user to permanently destroy any Legendary Artifact.

**WARNING:** [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] strongly encourages its members to refrain from destroying any Legendary Artifacts. Instead, please between them to your local IMAS hall so they can be studied.

>[!idea]
>Maybe [[CURSED AL]] is using IMAS to collect the Artifacts for him.

>[!question] But doesn't he hate IMAS? Or is blacklisted by them?
>Ah, see, it's the perfect cover! No one would ever believe he was behind it all. Or maybe it's how [[James RedawiÄ‡|James]] is manipulating [[Luke Campbell|Luke]]. "You see, young one, it is an ancient rite of passage for wizards to collect the Seven Legendary Artifacts before being granted admission to IMAS. It's like a snipe hunt but for mages."

>[!question] If James tells him it's a snipe hunt, wouldn't he know that he's not expected to actually find them?
>Maybe, but remember that Luke is an idiot.

Oh, maybe that's another reason he grabs a [[Chocolate Orange]] instead of [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]]. He's just joking like, "Haha, look, I found THE ORB!"

[[Case Weston|Case]] laughs and says, "THE ORB is red, you dingus."

"What do you mean? [[LukeVISION (TM)|This is red]]!"

"Dude, are you colorblind or something? That's..." His voice trails off as he notices something.

"Colorblind?" Luke asks under his breath, sounding slightly offended, though mostly confused. Case lightly hits him in the chest to get his attention. "What?"

"Dude, look! THE ORB! The real one! It's right over there!" Case says, awestruck.

Luke becomes so excited his ears perk up involuntarily, inadvertently revealing to Case that he is a dogboy.

They grab THE ORB, and Luke looks at the chocolate orange that he's still carrying. "Well, I guess I can eat this now."

"Hey, you need to pay for that!" Case admonishes.

"Pay who? It's been sitting in this warehouse God knows how long. They're not going to miss it! I don't think this store is even in business anymore."

"But you can't eat that anyway! You're a dogboy!"

"Who told you I was a dogboy?!"

"You did, dumbass." He points to Luke's ears. "Your ears?"

"Aw, man... I hate when they do that."

"Anyway, give me that! You can't have it!"

"No!" (Didn't anyone ever tell Case not to try and take food from a dogboy?) Luke growls and bares his teeth.

The two boys begin to tussle. Luke offers Case half of the orange; Case is convinced Luke shouldn't have any of it. Luke has a hard time accepting that Case is only looking out for his health. In all the commotion, they don't realize they have accidentally triggered a long dormant security system. Luke drops the chocolate orange (now out of its box), and it rolls away.

>[!objective] 
>Escape the warehouse

>[!objective]
>Recover and eat the chocolate orange

I don't know if this game's UI is going to have a way of distinguishing main and side quests, but if it does, it's important that these both appear as main quests. They are of equal importance to Luke.
