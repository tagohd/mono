*1st-level evocation*

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Materials: None
- Duration: Instantaneous

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

>[!warning]
>This spell is roughly equivalent to basic first aid. In the event of serious injury, [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]] advises you to seek help from a medical professional.

>[!note]
>This is one of the few reliable healing spells. Healing magic is extremely complicated. Most magic use in medicine tends to center more around creating raw materials. For reasons unknown, infectious diseases and chronic conditions tend to resist magical treatment. Many of IMAS's most prominent members are dedicated to researching this.
