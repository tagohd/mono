*9th-level necromancy*

- Casting Time: 1 hour
- Range: Self
- Materials: A large flawless diamond, 60 liters of virgin blood[^1], 1 kg fresh vanilla beans[^2], 10 ingots of pure silver, and a [[Legendary Artifacts|Legendary Artifact]]. All but the artifact are consumed by the spell.
- Duration: Permanent

The user ages incredibly slowly, effectively rendering them unable to die of old age. They no longer need to eat or drink. They may still be killed by other means, including wounds or magical effects.

[^1]: Equivalent to about 12 people
[^2]: Thought about vanilla extract for the meme, but figured fresh vanilla beans would be much harder to obtain. Point is this spell is expensive and requires materials that aren't easy to come by.
