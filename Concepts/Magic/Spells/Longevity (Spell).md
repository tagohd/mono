*9th-level necromancy*

- Casting Time: 1 hour
- Range: Self
- Materials: A large flawless diamond, 60 liters of virgin blood[^1], 1 kg fresh vanilla beans[^2], 10 ingots of pure silver, and the [[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH]]. All but the CHALICE are consumed by the spell.
- Duration: Permanent

You age incredibly slowly, effectively becoming unable to die of old age. You no longer need to eat or drink, and you recover from illness in half the normal time. You may still be killed by other means, including wounds or magical effects. This spell does not *reverse* aging—you will maintain the age you were when you first cast the spell.

>[!info]
>You do still age, but a creature with a lifespan of, say, 70 years, now has a lifespan of 7000 years—you're much more likely to die of other causes first.

The toll of this spell is enormous. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent change that you are unable to use magic ever again.[^3]

[^1]: Equivalent to about 12 people
[^2]: Thought about vanilla extract for the meme, but figured fresh vanilla beans would be much harder to obtain. TBH, the materials don't really matter. The spell's already been cast; not like it's going to be cast again. Point is this spell is expensive and requires materials that aren't easy to come by/aren't likely to be sourced ethically. Maybe instead of all that, it just requires a philosopher's stone? (But creating a philosopher's stone would be similarly immoral.)
[^3]: This part was just copied from the description of [[Wish]].


[Lun]: This is discriminatory against non-virgins. What's wrong with their blood? Does sex alter the magical properties of your body?? I need answers. 

[Sudo]: Fuckin'... idk. It just seems to be the standard for Satanic rituals for some reason. No, you know what? You're right. Instead of virgin blood, it should be cishet blood. And that's what kills [[Boring Straight Greg]].

[Lun]: So now non-cishet blood is bad? UHOH, sudo = racism confirmed?!?!?!

[Sudo]: No, silly. Satan doesn't want gay blood because those are *his* people. So it has to be cishet blood.

[Lun]: Oh, nice save. So is Satan an actual canon character in this story and is he an ally? ^2618c6

sudo:: Maybe Satan == [[Emperoress, The|The Emperoress]]? 


[Lun]: Oh shit, that's a wild idea. But how does Satan work in MONO??? Some sort of [[Mana]] demon or something? Or OP mages can use magic to "ascend"? Maybe they're the first one to have casted [[Longevity (Spell)|Longevity]]?? Though that kind off subtracts from AL being the ancient evil super-powerful mage. I'm not sure how to make another one work in the story.

sudo:: Bro, [[Emperoress, The|The Emperoress]] was your idea XD

Also, alternate idea for the whole sacrificing cost:
- You don't need blood to cast the spell, you just need a lot of mana
	- E.g. this cost is not inherent to this spell, you can cast it without killing a bunch of people if you had a Big Fucking Soul™
- AL doesn't have this amount of mana, so he uses an early version of the [[BFS 10000]] instead
	- Pretty much a shorter version of the full one:
		- Reap some souls
		- Jam them directly into [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]]
		- Quickly cast your spell because girl those souls are dissipating (no living holder)
	- Much more unstable, which gives a chance to mess up the spell
		- RIP James lol


[Sudo]: Yeah, the point wasn't so much the blood anyway. It was more: this spell is hella unethical, and you're basically stealing the life essence of other people to prolong your own life. (The addition of magic is what makes it a thousandfold increase instead of simply a twelvefold increase.)

[Lun]: How about both blood and the soul thing. Satanic rituals!!!

[Sudo]: I mean, if you're taking their SOUL using the [[BLADE OF POWER]], I would assume there's probably some bloodshed involved anyway?

[Lun]: Haha yes stabby time!!
