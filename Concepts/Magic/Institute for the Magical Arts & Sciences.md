alias: IMAS, The Wizard Club (TM)
---

IMAS for short. (Thought about calling it "Arcane Institute for Magical Sciences" so it would abbreviate to AIMS, but that sounded too made-up. How about "International Council of Bards and Magicians", or ICBM?)

A professional association for scholars of the arcane. Like a cross between IEEE, the Catholic church, and the College of Winterhold. Publishes standards and best practices for the use of magic. Funds research into the study of magic, including the creation of new [[List of Spells|spells]].

Less ethical wizards like [[James Redawić|James]] or [[CURSED AL]] tend to dislike them, and the feeling is mutual.

%%
question:: What is James's and/or CURSED AL's backstory with IMAS? Were they expelled?
%%

[Lun]: Maybe they were some prominent members until they performed some unethical spells to become functionally immortal as suggested in [[(Talk) James Redawić]]? I'd imagine The Wizard Club™ wouldn't be too fond of that. But then what did they do about it. Try to kill them? They're some of the most powerful wizards around, that would probably get messy. I'd imagine it would be more of a cold war scenario where the IMAS puts heavy restrictions/bans on the two until they chill out a bit, and threaten to actually send people after them if they keep going. Not sure

[Sudo]: One idea I had that I think I mentioned in [[Case Weston|Case's]] article is that maybe James is defrauding them out of a lot of grant money and that's why Case is put on the case. If it was anything more major than that, I think IMAS would have to have a bit more authority than IEEE, making them more like an official government agency. Or maybe the Spanish Inquisition. Nobody would expect that.
[Sudo]: Or, as I alluded to in [[Longevity (Spell)]], maybe they were expelled for merely researching it[^1]? On the other hand, they're also both incredibly old; it's possible they cast the spell before IMAS was even founded. Maybe they were expelled after they were found out. They were like, "Hey, thanks for the numerous advancements to our research, but what you did was super fucked up and we don't want to be associated with you." ^i-also-mentioned-it-here

[^1]: That reference was only there for like one hour. Oops. (The warning box at the top used to imply that IMAS was unaware anyone had ever successfully cast the spell.)

%%
sudoMajor: Given how old James and AL are, it's possible they cast Longevity before IMAS was even founded. Maybe there was some [Operation Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip) bullshit.

This was in [[1. Plot Overview]], so I'm marking it as read.
