alias: IMAS, The Wizard Club (TM)
---

IMAS for short. (Thought about calling it "Arcane Institute for Magical Sciences" so it would abbreviate to AIMS, but that sounded too made-up. How about "International Council of Bards and Magicians", or ICBM?)

A professional association for scholars of the arcane. Like a cross between IEEE, the Catholic church, and the College of Winterhold. Publishes standards and best practices for the use of magic. Funds research into the study of magic, including the creation of new [[List of Spells|spells]].

Less ethical wizards like [[James Redawić|James]] or [[CURSED AL]] tend to dislike them, and the feeling is mutual.

[Lun]: Maybe they were some prominent members until they performed some unethical spells to become functionally immortal as suggested in [[James's Excuse]]? I'd imagine The Wizard Club™ wouldn't be too fond of that. But then what did they do about it. Try to kill them? They're some of the most powerful wizards around, that would probably get messy. I'd imagine it would be more of a cold war scenario where the IMAS puts heavy restrictions/bans on the two until they chill out a bit, and threaten to actually send people after them if they keep going. Not sure
