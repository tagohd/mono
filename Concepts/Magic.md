Wouldn't be much of an RPG without spells, would it?

Had an idea for a magic system I thought was kind of cool, so I'm just going to suggest that here:

You know how in a lot of magic systems you have some sort of magical energy (let's call it [[Mana]]) flowing around freely in the air? It starts from the same concept, but it's separated from the physical plane and just kind of chilling in [[Mana Plane|its own plane]] superimposed on our plane. 
So if you want to cast a spell, you need to get some mana from the mana-plane into the physical plane. Casters can do this by pretty literally poking a hole in the veil between the two planes, causing mana to flow into this one. And then they can use this mana to cast whatever spell they want! 
So in this system, what limits a caster from casting infinite powerful spells is not their own magical energy that has to recharge but rather the need to make sure that there isn't too much mana flowing into the physical realm. Imagine you're a mage and you want to cast Super Meteor of Major Fucking Mayhem. You could perfectly poke a big enough hole in the plane veil to get enough mana to cast that, no problem. Whether you can control that amount of mana and form it into the spell you want is up to how good you are, but let's assume you got that down - you can cast your spell! However, after you had your fun blasting whatever into oblivion, you may now notice that there is still a gaping hole in the plane veil spouting mana into this realm. This is a problem because mana is essentially pure, unstable energy and now you and everything within a few miles radius around you is going to go boom! Or, regarding the chaotic nature of mana, maybe something even worse! 
This is why, in order to not have a boatload of Boom Juice seeping freely into our world, casters not only need to be able to poke a hole into the veil and be able to control the mana coming out, they also need to be able to stitch the hole they just poked back up, and that while controlling all mana coming out. Luckily for casters, the veil between planes starts closing from itself as soon as a hole has been poked through, so for small holes you don't need any stitching and for larger holes stitching it a bit roughly is good enough.

This system has some of the following practical consequences:
- You can cast as many spells as you want as long as they're cast in different locations! (Assuming you can and do patch the veil for all of them)
	- This encourages the player to move around the screen a lot, and even going to places you typically don't want to be (e.g. dangerously close to a boss) because you can still cast a spell there
- Spells weak enough that they can't damage the veil to the point of free mana spills are commonly taught to people, even non-mages, since they're both easy to cast and safe.
	-  (Mini-)Bosses could have some fun magic moves despite them being non-casters (rogues going invisible or a small speed-boost or something)
- Powerful spells have longer casting times because it includes patching the veil. You can also choose not to do that last step for faster casting, but that will have major repercussions. This goes the same for casting spells above your magical level, for which you can't patch the veil quickly enough. Or casting a spell in an area where the veil was still recovering.
	- Free mana could convert into various magical effects, like huge screen-wide AoE explosions (can also be used to kill enemies in a pinch if you can tank the hit!), time speeding up or slowing down in an area, matter coming into or out of existence, magical barriers forming (potentially trapping the player with a bunch of monsters hehe), etc.
		- Perhaps enough free mana could cause such pronounced, long-lasting (permanent?) effects on the caster that one might consider them to be CURSED... (cough cough [[CURSED AL]])

Involves the [[SOUL]] somehow, hence the desire for the [[SOUL AMPLIFIER]]. (Since I have yet to define what the SOUL is, maybe it doesn't make sense to amplify them; I might have to change the name later.) But maybe the SOUL acts like a lightning rod for mana, or the SOUL itself is the one doing the amplification. Maybe mana comes in a variety of wavelengths and each SOUL has a specific "resonant frequency", so to speak. If you want to cast a protection spell, you channel green mana; if you want to cast Magic Missile, you channel yellow mana; etc.

[Lun]: I didn't! Very cool!

This isn't to say that only certain people can cast certain spells. It's just that certain spells come easier to you if your SOUL is the right "color". ^03cfb6

[Lun]: I like the Mana-SOUL connection, but maybe this is just a bit too much uhhh "borrowing" from undertale? Maybe people can train their SOUL to better resonate with certain mana (which would translate to like leveling a skill tree in game) rather than it being a born trait? Or maybe it doesn't work like an amplifier at all, but instead works like kind of a Mana-container you can fill by poking rifts between the realms and thereafter use it to cast a spell? In which case it functions like kind of a classic Mana-bar, except that you charge it by poking holes in the veil between dimensions and that you have to immediately use all of the Mana you stored to cast a spell because storing pure, highly unstable energy in your body for a maintained duration is not the safest thing to do. So in essence it functions like a sort of Mana-stabilizer and converter.

[Sudo]: Oh, so we're just gonna steal from Hollow Knight instead? SOUL Vessels? (And you poke rifts between planes by attacking enemies?) But, yeah, whenever I suggest something that's just "blatant plagiarism of Undertale", I'm mostly joking. Mostly. (But really, it's more like a placeholder until I come up with something that's less "blatant plagiarism of Undertale".)
