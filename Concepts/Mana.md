It's kinda like The Force, except somehow way nerdier. And no midichlorians. Wait. Music pun. Uh... MIDIdorians. It has MIDIdorians instead.

It exists in a separate plane to reality. [[Magic]] users pierce the veil between planes to access mana, and then focus the mana with their [[SOUL|SOULS]] in order to cast spells.
