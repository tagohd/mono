I feel like I've made enough changes that it might be easier to just start a new document (again).

# 1 First Loop
Everything before [[Outline EX#1.2.2 The Approach/Approach to the Inmost Cave|The Approach]] is the same.
## 1.1 Departure
This entire "Act" takes place on 18 Sep.
### 1.1.1 Ordinary World
- [[Luke Campbell|Luke]] lives a boring life in a boring town called [[Genton]]. We've been over this many times already. Nothing new here.

### 1.1.2 Call to Adventure
- [[Sam Ward|Sam]] doesn't show up for their morning run with Luke. The [[Plata Fairgrounds|Renaissance Faire]] is this weekend, and this will be Sam's first time attending. Luke suspects they were simply overeager and left early (because that's the kind of thing *he* would do). He saddles up [[Luke's Noble Steed|Pauline]] and starts riding towards [[Plata]].
	- Luke jousts, so he'll need Pauline there anyway.
	- Plata is only 35 km (21.75 mi) away from Genton. He can get there on horseback no problem, but it will take a while.
		- About 20-30 minutes by car, but at least a couple hours by horse.
			- Assuming Pauline is in good shape, she can probably maintain a trot of 8-12 mph for 20 miles, so it would take approximately 2 hours at that speed.
			- Luke probably won't ride that fast so she doesn't get exhausted, plus they'll need to stop for water every so often. So, let's say it takes about 3 hours? (Not 5.5 hours like I've said previously.)
		- Ideally, he would take Pauline there in a horse trailer, but Luke isn't a very good driver.
		- Couldn't he just ask one of [[The Mothers Campbell|his moms]] to take him? Well, he's *supposed* to be in school that day. Also, they're busy. [[Elizabeth Campbell|Elizabeth]] is going to take him tomorrow, though.
		- Actually, it's 35 km as measured from the center of Genton to the center of Plata. But Luke doesn't live in Genton proper. [[Campbell Farms]] is likely on the outskirts, so it could be a bit closer.
	- Does he put on his armor before he leaves?
		- Can he do that by himself? (Depends on the armor, but it's possible.)
		- Can he mount Pauline unassisted if he does? (Might be kinda hard, especially with his hip problems.)
		- Wouldn't that be kinda uncomfortable to wear all day? (At least the weather is probably pretty cool.)
		- If he doesn't put it on before he leaves, how does he get it there? And when *does* he put it on?
- [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|Edna]] attacks.
	- Well, people assume she's attacking, but she doesn't really do anything. Everyone freaks out anyway, resulting in a riot.
	- Pauline is injured in the ensuing chaos.
	- Luke is not having a good time.
- [[Case Weston|Case]] shows up. He wasn't attending the Faire, but he, too, is a Good Boy (TM), and he's there to help if he can.
	- He spots Luke, who is clearly shaken up and trying desperately to keep Pauline under control so she doesn't exacerbate her injuries.
	- Case knows a little bit of healing magic, so he heals Pauline, but she should still probably be checked by a professional.
	- If he hasn't already, this would probably be a good time for Luke to take off his armor. Maybe Case suggests it. Like, "Hey, you're kinda freaking out right now, and that's a totally valid reaction to surviving a dragon attack, but maybe you'd feel better if you weren't wearing fucking plate armor?"
- Luke asks Case if he's seen anyone who looks like Sam. He still hasn't found them, and now he's worried that maybe they were kidnapped by the dragon.
	- He hasn't, and he's not sure about that last part. Maybe [[James Redawić|James]] would know more.
- James is offended by the suggestion that Edna would kidnap anyone. No, it's more likely that Sam was kidnapped by [[CURSED AL]].
	- How does James know this? He doesn't. He just knows that AL has returned, and whatever he's planning is probably going to require at least a few sacrifices.
- Sensing Luke's desperation to save Sam, James sees an opportunity: he can use Luke to gather the materials he will need to cast [[Wizard Divorce]] and be rid of AL for good.
	- He tells Luke that it was clearly fate that brought him here. Luke must be THE CHOSEN ONE foretold by the prophecy James is *totally* not making up on the spot.

### 1.1.3 Refusal of the Call
- It's not that Luke doesn't want to be THE CHOSEN ONE. He wants to save Sam, of course. But is he really the right person for the job? He's only 16. He was terrified when Edna attacked. And he doesn't know magic. (Well, won't know unless he tries...)
- Refusing the call is part of the prophecy, so obviously this means that Luke really is THE CHOSEN ONE. Luke is not smart enough to question this any further.

### 1.1.4 Meeting with the Mentor
- James reluctantly agrees to teach Luke the magic he needs to know. He'll also send Case along with him.
	- **James:** Excellent! According to the prophecy, you must first gather the seven [[Legendary Artifacts]]. AL will be seeking these as well, but it is vital that you find them first.
	- **Luke:** Right, okay, one problem.
	- **James:** What?
	- **Luke:** AL's a wizard, right? And I don't know if you heard me earlier, but I don't know magic. I barely even know algebra.
	- **James:** Yes... Right, I can see how that would be a concern. Since AL likely has a significant head start, (*slightly sarcastic*) it seems the honor of instructing THE CHOSEN ONE has fallen upon me. However, it is quite late \[22:00 (lol)\]. We will begin your training first thing in the morning. Mr Weston, you may wish to join as well.
	- **James:** In the meantime, I suggest you freshen up. I can tell you were quite... active, today.
	- **Luke:** Sir?
	- **James:** Go home and take a shower, kid. You reek. Maybe tell your parents you're THE CHOSEN ONE; I'm sure they'll be thrilled. But be back here at sunup. We have a lot of ground to cover.
		- In my head, I feel like his voice suddenly switched from Obi-Wan Kenobi to J. Jonah Jameson. (Or perhaps from Hero (OMORI) to Mr Jawsum.) Maybe the "sagely British guy" act is just that: an act. (Or maybe it's just: he would not fucking say that.)
		- Wait, that might be kinda weird for Case, then. Since Luke's going to be riding bitch on his motorcycle. (Maybe not. It is a motorcycle.)
	- **Luke:** Yessir. Thank you, sir!
	- **James:** Don't thank me yet. Now, go!

### 1.1.5 Crossing the First Threshold
- Luke returns home to tell [[The Mothers Campbell|his moms]] he is leaving to save Sam. They are, quite reasonably, not very enthusiastic about this, largely for the same reasons as Luke.
	- Luke's like, "I was surprised about this, too, but I must have what it takes since I'm THE CHOSEN ONE."
	- One of his mothers (probably [[Elizabeth Campbell|Elizabeth]], since she's supposed to be the smart one) asks if he's sure James is right about him being THE CHOSEN ONE.
	- Case assures her that James is himself a powerful wizard and probably knows what he's talking about. (Case is there because he drove Luke home from Plata.)
		- Is Case gonna stay the night? Again, Plata isn't that far, but it is late, and Luke's parents are good people. They might want him to stay just to be safe. At the very least, they'll want to thank him for helping their son—he gets some supplies, too.
		- If Luke's back on the farm, how is he returning to Plata? Is Case taking him? Could make sense if he's staying the night, less so if he isn't. But, 1) Pauline is still in Plata, so someone's going to have to get her, and 2) before he left on his own to look for Sam, the original plan was that Elizabeth would drive him to the Renaissance Faire tomorrow, anyway.
		- Why did Case drive Luke back from Plata, anyway? (Because I wanted it to happen.)
			- Why didn't one of his moms just pick him up?
				- Luke's an idiot, and it didn't occur him to call one of them? (I was thinking more that they would come there on their own, assuming they heard about the dragon. So that's not really an answer...)
				- Case volunteered? Not because he likes him or anything. (I know we've said he's tsundere, but also: they literally just met. It's really not because he likes him.) But, Luke *is* THE CHOSEN ONE. Maybe he views it as an honor? Though, like I said, Case is also a Good Boy (TM), so he would probably do it even if Luke was Just Some Guy (which he is).
			- Why didn't he ride Pauline back? This one's easy: it's 20-30 minutes by motorcycle, but ~3 hours by horse. Plus, even if Edna didn't happen, Luke already rode her *to* Plata. She's tired. (Also, shouldn't his parents have noticed earlier that Pauline was missing, even if they assumed Luke was at school? Were all three of his moms away?)
			- Why doesn't he just take a train? I'm American, so correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems unlikely that there would be a train between two small towns that also runs at night. You might be able to catch a train from Plata to Rhapsody at that hour, but not one that's going to stop in Genton.
		- Where does Case even live? Did IMAS set him up with an apartment? Is he staying with James and [[Grigori Karstov|Grigori]]? (See the "Case File" thread.) Would James be okay with that? (He's probably not thrilled.)
- Luke's mothers relent and decide to let him go. They know he would go anyway. They give him some supplies to get him ready for his journey. Among the supplies is [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]], one of the Legendary Artifacts.
	- I don't think any of them are aware that it's a Legendary Artifact.

## 1.2 Initiation
### 1.2.1 Tests, Allies, and Enemies
19 Sep - 21 Sep
- Luke and Case learn some spells
	- Case is older and smarter than Luke, plus he took some magic classes in [[Paul W. Friendship High School|high school]], so he has a bit of an advantage over Luke.
	- This may cause Luke to view Case as something of a rival. (Luke is competitive?)
	- Case doesn't see it that way (it's not a competition; they're trying to save the world). But maybe he's a little bit jealous that Luke gets to be THE CHOSEN ONE. This may reverse as the loops continue and Luke ends up more skilled.
	- What spells do they learn? How many do they learn before James starts sending them after the Artifacts?
- James is pushing Luke really hard, and Luke's not doing that well with it. (He'll just have to try harder.) He perseveres because he believes it's necessary to save Sam.
	- If Case is there, wouldn't he have some objections to James's teaching methods?
		- Oh. If I do give him the sad backstory that I mentioned in "Case File", maybe he just... thinks it's normal? Like, "Yep, this is how people are taught things."
		- Or he doesn't feel it's safe for him to object, especially if he lives with James. James might turn his abuse towards Case instead, or threaten to kick him out. (Even if James wouldn't kick him out (Grigori would kill him), it's still something Case *thinks* could happen, because maybe it wouldn't be the first time.)
			- "Case intentionally draws the abuse to get James to ease off Luke" - No. I don't know how to explain it, but that does not sit right with me. Like he's being abused "heroically"? Like it's *his* fault for not stopping Luke from being abused, and not James's fault for abusing both of them in the first place? (Though Case very well might think that, similar to how Luke thinks it's his fault Case dies. Doesn't mean either is correct.) But I think the big thing is this: it is perfectly rational that Case would not want to be abused either.
			- Ooh, wait. Maybe on the timeline without Case, James really does kick Case out, and Grigori is the one who kills James. Or Luke still kills him, but it's definitely not an accident. (Bonus: Luke's like, "Great, even though he didn't die, I still ended up making his life worse.")

### 1.2.2 The Approach/Approach to the Inmost Cave
- (22 Sep) After 3 days of intense training, James decides Luke and Case are ready to start gathering the [[Legendary Artifacts]] (they aren't).
- The first Artifact they get is [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]], located in [[Rhapsody]]
	- Rhapsody is about 409 km from Plata, so it probably takes them about 3 hours to get there on Case's motorcycle.
	- Amazingly, the warehouse where it's kept is not very closely guarded. Seems like a pretty easy mission...
	- ...Until they accidentally trigger the security systems
	- Luke has been struggling a lot with his lessons, occasionally doubting whether he truly is THE CHOSEN ONE, but he manages to cast a powerful spell, saving Case from a close call
	- It's not a spell Luke should know. It's way above his level, and he gets some pretty bad [[Mana#Mana Toxicity|Mana toxicity]] symptoms. But, it's a good boost to his confidence. (I'm also going to say right now that the more severe symptoms don't always kick in right away. They have enough time to get out of the warehouse, and maybe they'll even be partway back to Plata before Luke really begins to feel it. And, of course, this will happen less frequently as he builds tolerance.)
	- Case is surprised that Luke knew that spell but figures James's intense training must really be working. Though if/when he realizes that Luke is experiencing severe mana toxicity, he's going to be very pissed at James. (James: Well, he saved your life, didn't he? And he's still alive. I don't see what the problem is here.)
		- Luke would probably try to hide this from Case. Mix of animal instinct to hide pain, desire to look cool in front of Case, not wanting him to worry, and of course, denial.
		- If they've been training together, the surprise is likely more that Luke managed to do it, not that he knew the spell in the first place. So, it's more like, "Hey! You finally did it! I know you've been struggling with that spell, so great job!"
		- Likewise, Case might not be surprised that Luke is suffering from Mana toxicity. It's that Case has never seen such a severe case of it in person before. It's one thing to read about the symptoms in a book, but seeing it happen right in front of you is obviously more visceral.
	- Let's say it takes a couple hours to get THE ORB. They're exhausted, especially Luke, who's beginning to feel the onset of Mana toxicity. Maybe they decide to stay the night somewhere in Rhapsody rather than making the drive back to Plata. In addition to feeling pretty sick, Luke has some weird dreams.
		- As above, Luke probably denies feeling ill, but Case might insist on staying there when he sees how unwell Luke looks.
		- I don't know what the dreams are yet, but they're probably plot relevant.
- (23 Sep) They return to Plata and learn some new spells.
- (24 Sep) Maybe they try to get [[CRYSTAL OF GRELLNATH|THE CRYSTAL]] next, only to find that AL has already taken it.
	- THE CRYSTAL is (allegedly) pretty far away, about 1600 km as the crow flies. That's 12 hours one way.
	- So, let's say it takes about 3 days to get there, find out THE CRYSTAL is gone, and get back to Plata.
- (27 Sep) Then they go to get [[BLADE OF POWER|THE BLADE]], which is located on [[Lovers' Island]].
	- As the crow flies, the coast is at least 600 km away from Plata, but there's also a mountain range in the way. Let's say the port is on the peninsula, and they travel up the highways to go around the mountain range instead of through it. So, the distance to the port is about 969 km, and the distance to Lovers' Island is 301 km.
		- This would make the drive to the port about 7.5 hours. Maybe there's a bullet train instead?
	- (This might be Luke's first time going to the beach. He probably wishes it was under different circumstances.)
		- Wait, I thought the beach episode usually came later...
	- They'll need a boat to get to the island, obviously. They attempt to hire [[Iris van Halt]] to take them there, but they don't have enough money.
	- They offer her THE ORB, but she doesn't want it.
		- They can't sell it to anyone else. Either they don't know what it is and make a fair offer for what appears to be an ordinary glass ball (i.e. not very much), or they *do* know what it is and want nothing to do with it.
	- They offer to join her crew, but she would prefer sailors with a bit more experience (and muscle).
	- Luke takes offence to the suggestion that he isn't strong. Iris challenges the boys to best her in some form of physical contest (arm wrestling?). They have no hope of winning.
	- If they can't get to THE BLADE, they won't be able to rescue Sam. Feeling hopeless, Luke begins to cry. Case is furious with Iris for making Luke cry.
		- Even though Iris is still clearly stronger than Case, she's actually kinda scared of him now. She relents.
		- Luke thinks that was kinda hot of Case.
	- This whole exchange probably doesn't take longer than 30 minutes, but the boat ride will likely take longer.
		- To use the only comparable experience that I've had, Portsmouth, UK to Saint-Malo, France is about 319 km, and the ferry takes 11 hours. Now, Iris may not be operating a typical ferry; she may be able to go faster. (The trip from Portsmouth to Caen is 86 km shorter, but can apparently be completed in nearly half the time, so there must be some other factors, as well.) Let's say it takes 6 hours.
	- There may be some other challenges before they can get THE BLADE. Or maybe they face difficulty getting back to the mainland.
	- They may not return to the same port, but it will likely take a similar amount of time. So, let's say getting THE BLADE takes 2 days altogether.
- (29 Sep) After successfully retrieving THE BLADE, they move on to [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM|THE STAFF]].
	- Do they return to Plata first, or do they go directly to THE STAFF?
		- It would probably be faster to go directly to THE STAFF.
	- THE STAFF is guarded by the [[KNIGHTS OF RULKOHIM]], who occupy the [[TEMPLE OF RULKOHIM]] on the mountain [[Tollenberg]], the tallest mountain on the continent (possibly on the world).
		- Another long drive (~6 hours). I hope Case's motorcycle is comfortable. (Or they take a bullet train. The real fantasy here is the amazing public transit.)
			- Well, I'm also assuming Case is averaging around 100 kph, but let's be realistic here. He's an 18 year old boy on a motorcycle, and they're on a quest to save the world. Do you really think he's going to drive responsibly? (Didn't I already say this somewhere?) So, at 130 kph, it's about 4hr 45min. (I've adjusted the other travel times accordingly.)
	- The KNIGHTS are obviously quite protective of THE STAFF and don't give it to just anyone. Case and Luke will have to prove their worthiness.
		- They probably have to answer some riddles or something.
	- After proving their worthiness, Case takes THE STAFF as his main weapon. He may stay behind for a bit to undergo specialized training from the KNIGHTS.
		- They're much nicer than James. When this is all over, Case wouldn't mind living with them. He could use some parents. (Luke: Hey, I have parents, too! I wouldn't mind sharing them with Case...)
		- Actually, if Case is staying behind, maybe Luke has to take the bullet train.
		- Or maybe he gets a ride from one of the KNIGHTS.

### 1.2.3 The Ordeal
1 Oct
- While attempting to retrieve [[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH|THE CHALICE]], Luke encounters AL for the first time. Despite James's "best" efforts, he is woefully unprepared, and AL beats him handily.
- Case shows up in the nick of time to save Luke, repaying him for saving his life in Rhapsody.
- Luke wonders why he lost if he's THE CHOSEN ONE. (He'll just have to try harder.) Case assures him that it's simply because he hasn't completed his training. (And maybe there's a sweet moment where Case promises that he'll never let Luke face AL alone again.)

### 1.2.4 Reward
3-6 Oct (THE CHALICE was really far away...)
- Luke returns to finish his training. James teaches him a very powerful spell, but Luke accidentally kills James when he tries to cast it.
	- Let's say the spell is [[Greater Fuck You Up Big Time]] for now.
- As he dies, James begrudgingly admits that he is proud of Luke, and that he has a message for Luke to deliver to AL when next they meet: James still remembers AL.
	- Do Case and Luke know that AL is James's ex-husband? If they didn't, do they know now?

## 1.3 Return
### 1.3.1 The Road Back
7-11 Oct
- Luke and Case make their way to [[CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN]].
	- Even if collecting The Artifacts was easy, this is going to be a challenge.
- With the spell and the message, Luke should be able to defeat AL. 
### 1.3.2 The Resurrection
12 Oct
- Despite this, AL is *still* able to defeat them easily.
- Case sacrifices himself to save Luke.
- Just as AL is preparing to cast [[Reverse Fate]], Luke cries out for him to wait. He has a message from James.
	- Lol, what if AL's reaction is just, "Yeah, I'd fucking hope he remembers me. We were married for like 200 years..."
- Regardless of AL's reaction, he's distracted long enough for Sam to do some shenanigans
	- They make a deal with [[Emperoress, The|The Emperoress]] for Luke to be able to remember the previous timelines. Who knows how many loops there have been? Even Sam isn't sure, but they know this isn't the first one.
- AL casts Reverse Fate, but instead of resurrecting James, it resets the timeline to the beginning of the story.
	- Technically, this *does* resurrect James...

### 1.3.3 The Return/Return with the Elixir
- Nope. Not on this timeline.

## 1.4 Lessons Learned
What does Luke remember from this timeline? Not much, really. Mostly just vague impressions. He might remember events as they're happening, but usually not to an extent than he can really do anything about them.

# 2 Second Loop
This hasn't really changed that much, except for removing any references to Sam being memory-holed.
## 2.1 Departure
### 2.1.1 Ordinary World
- Luke lives a boring life in a boring town called Genton.

### 2.1.2 Call to Adventure
- Sam doesn't show up for their morning run with Luke. The Renaissance Faire is this weekend, and this will be Sam's first time attending. Luke suspects they were simply overeager and left early (because that's the kind of thing *he* would do). He saddles up Pauline and starts riding towards Plata.
	- Maybe he has a weird dream about Sam the night before, or about the dragon attack. Or both.
- Edna attacks. Luke has déjà vu.
	- Maybe he's a little less terrified since he knew it was coming?
- Case shows up. Luke thinks he looks familiar. Case doesn't feel the same.
- Luke mentions his weird dreams and déjà vu, and Case suggests they talk to James about it.

### 2.1.3 Refusal of the Call
- James confirms that the déjà vu is real. Luke really has done this before.
	- James suspects this is the work of CURSED AL.
	- If Luke wants to break the time loop, he'll need to gather the Legendary Artifacts and defeat AL.
- Luke may question how good of a CHOSEN ONE he really is since he's apparently failed to break the time loop, but he ultimately resigns himself to his fate. (He'll just have to try harder.)

### 2.1.4 Meeting with the Mentor
- James reluctantly agrees to teach Luke the magic he needs to know. He'll also send Case along with him.
- Luke agrees to be taught.

### 2.1.5 Crossing the First Threshold
- Luke returns home to tell his parents he's going on a quest.
- Luke's moms aren't super stoked about this, but hey! Their son is THE CHOSEN ONE! That's something to be proud of, right? Plus, who are they to interfere with fate?
- They give him some supplies, including THE NEEDLE.

## 2.2 Initiation
### 2.2.1 Tests, Allies, and Enemies
- Luke and Case learn some spells
	- Maybe Case tries to ask him what he remembers about the previous timeline. Luke doesn't remember Case dying, but he gets the sense that they spent a lot of time together. (That's kinda obvious, though. Point is, he doesn't really remember anything specific.)
- James is pushing Luke really hard, and Luke's not doing that well with it. (He'll just have to try harder.) He perseveres because he believes it's necessary to save Sam.

### 2.2.2 The Approach
- Luke and Case set out to gather the Legendary Artifacts
- They get THE ORB
- ~~They get THE CRYSTAL~~
- They get THE BLADE
- They get THE STAFF
- Not much really changes here.

### 2.2.3 The Ordeal
- While attempting to retrieve THE CHALICE, Luke encounters AL for the "first" time. Despite James's "best" efforts, he is woefully unprepared, and AL beats him handily.
- Case, who is separated from Luke for some reason, shows up in the nick of time to save Luke, repaying him for saving his life in Rhapsody.
- Luke wonders why he lost if he's THE CHOSEN ONE. (He'll just have to try harder.) Case assures him that it's simply because he hasn't completed his training. (And maybe there's a sweet moment where Case promises that he'll never let Luke face AL alone again.)

### 2.2.4 Reward
- Luke returns to finish his training. James teaches him a very powerful spell, but Luke accidentally kills James when he tries to cast it. Maybe Luke has some more déjà vu about this, but it's too little, too late.
- As he dies, James begrudgingly admits that he is proud of Luke, and that he has a message for Luke to deliver to AL when next they meet: James still remembers AL.

## 2.3 Return
### 2.3.1 The Road Back
- Luke and Case make their way to CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN.
	- Even if collecting The Artifacts was easy, this is going to be a challenge.
- With the spell and the message, Luke should be able to defeat AL.

### 2.3.2 The Resurrection
- Despite this, AL is *still* able to defeat them easily. (He'll just have to try harder.)
- Case sacrifices himself to save Luke.
- Just as AL is preparing to cast Reverse Fate, Luke cries out for him to wait. He has a message from James.
- AL casts Reverse Fate anyway, but, for some reason, instead of resurrecting James, it resets the timeline to the beginning of the story.

### 2.3.3 The Return
![[no-jonathan-frakes.gif]]

## 2.4 Lessons Learned
- Edna is going to "attack" the Renaissance Faire.
- Case is a friend.

# 3 Third Loop
## 3.1 Departure
### 3.1.1 Ordinary World
- Luke lives a boring life in a boring town called Genton.

### 3.1.2 Call to Adventure
- Luke thinks Sam is in trouble, but he doesn't know how. Maybe they're already at the Renaissance Faire and will be endangered by the dragon.
