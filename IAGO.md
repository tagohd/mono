It's Another Goddamn Outline (except this time I'm going to try and keep it as simple as possible)

- Sam is missing
- Luke goes to look for them
- A dragon "attacks"
- Luke meets Case and James
- James tells Luke that he's THE CHOSEN ONE
- Luke doesn't know magic, so James teaches him some
- Luke and Case set out to look for the first Artifact
	- Let's say it's [[CHALICE OF SUDMORANTH|THE CHALICE]] for now
	- They overcome some minor hurdles to eventually succeed
- James teaches Luke some more magic
- They go to get the second Artifact
	- It's [[BLADE OF POWER|THE BLADE]]
	- Biggest problem is they're going to need transportation to the island it's on
	- They eventually convince [[Iris van Halt]] to take them there
	- Probably some other challenges, too
- They learn more magic and then get the third Artifact
	- This time it's [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB|THE ORB]]
	- Oh, wait, Case's parents have that one. Awkward...
	- Luke thinks it's a chocolate orange
	- Luke also saves Case's life somehow?
- More lessons, then on to Artifact No. 4
	- [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM|THE STAFF]] is at the top of a very tall mountain
	- It's a real bitch getting up there
	- Also, there are some monks, and they kind of adopt Case?
- With the fifth Artifact, they'll be very close to their goal
	- It's [[CRYSTAL OF GRELLNATH|THE CRYSTAL]], which is... somewhere
	- Luke's on his own for this one (see above about Case being adopted)
	- He gets ambushed by AL, who takes the other Artifacts from him
		- Do any of them know that Luke has [[NEEDLE OF CALAGASH|THE NEEDLE]]?
		- I'm going to say no
	- AL tells Luke that James has been lying to him about being THE CHOSEN ONE
	- Luke doesn't know how to feel about this
		- James has been an enormous bastard to him basically the whole time, so it's not really that big of a stretch
		- James *did* teach him magic, though
		- He also has no reason to trust AL at all
	- Case shows up at the last minute and saves Luke
- Luke has some questions for James
	- Does James come clean or does he double down?
- At some point, they realize that Luke has THE NEEDLE
- Luke accidentally(?) kills James
- Realizing he has the last Artifact AL needs, they decide to take the fight to him
	- Luke thinks he's going to be all badass like, "Looking for this?"
	- AL wipes the floor with him and turns Case into a pincushion
- The world ends
- Sam is missing
- Luke goes to look for them
- A dragon "attacks"
- Luke meets Case and James
- James tells Luke that he's THE CHOSEN ONE
- Hey, wait, doesn't this seem kinda familiar?
- It's probably nothing
- Things go more or less the same, except Luke has a persistent feeling of déjà vu
- Yada yada yada
- The world ends
- Sam is missing
- Luke goes to look for them
- A dragon "attacks"
- Luke meets Case and James
- James tells Luke that he's THE CHOSEN ONE
- Okay, hold on, this has definitely happened before
- Does anything really change? Maybe
	- It's left unclear exactly how many loops have occurred prior to this. This could be the third loop or it could be the thirtieth.
	- It's also heavily implied that the "first" loop wasn't really the first
- Case dies violently (again)
- The world ends (again)
- Sam is missing
- Luke goes to look for them
- A dragon "attacks"
- Luke remembers all the times Case got exploded and tries to go it alone so that Case can live for once
	- He actually does alright since he basically has precognition
	- Turns out James did actually teach him some things, too
	- He still gets his ass handed to him by AL, though, except Case isn't there to intervene this time
		- I've always thought that this would be an alternate scene with THE CRYSTAL, but maybe Luke decides to skip that one since he knows AL is going to ambush him
		- He might instead just go directly to [[CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN]] and confront him there
		- Or maybe he thinks he can take AL (in a fight) since he knows the ambush is coming
		- My point is, AL needs to get THE NEEDLE somehow in order for the current loop to end
	- Maybe AL keeps talking since he isn't interrupted by Case and inadvertently gives Luke a big hint?
		- Mentions Janus, e.g.
		- Something that implies Luke needs help from everyone; he can't do it alone
	- Maybe AL has also figured out that they're stuck in a time loop, or maybe Luke tells him
- The world ends
