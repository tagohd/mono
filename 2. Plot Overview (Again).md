# Timeline
## 11th Century
- **1047-06-10:** [[Emperoress, The|The Emperoress]] is born
- **1090-02-24:** [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder]] is born (hatches?)

## 12th Century
- **1123-03-27:** The Emperoress discovers *[[Longevity (Spell)|Longevity]]* and promptly fucks off into the shadows, leaving only a few hints of the spell's workings

## 17th Century
- **1666-01-07:** [[CURSED AL]] is born

## 18th Century
- **1722-02-04:** After decades of research, AL successfully casts *Longevity* on himself
- **1799-10-12:** [[James Redawić]] is born

## 19th Century
- **1832-03-06:** Hoping to find out the secret of AL's unnaturally long lifespan, James pledges to become his acolyte
- **1842-04-18:** James and AL get gay married
- **1852-08-18:** James and AL move to [[Plata]]
- **1852-09-26:** James and AL discover a huge lode of silver in Plata and begin mining it
	- They don't mine it themselves, obviously
	- Just realized that owning a silver mine is convenient in more than one way for them: They need silver for the spell, of course, but where do they get the [[SOUL|SOULS]] needed to cast *Longevity*? Well, no one's going to question it too much if there's a couple "mining accidents" every now and then, right?
- **1862-12-25:** AL attempts to cast *Longevity* on James, but fucks it up
- **1876-06-17:** AL attempts to cast *Longevity* again, but fucks it up even worse, paralyzing James and scattering the [[Legendary Artifacts]] across the tri-state area. Unbeknownst to either of them at the time, the spell actually (partially) succeeded. James will live until at least 2020.
	- AL devotes himself to finding out why the spell failed twice. The failed attempts and the numerous "accidents" at his mine earn him the nickname CURSED AL.
- **1877-07-28:** [[The Old Silver Mine]] runs dry

>[!note]
>I think it works better if James is paralyzed when AL departs. This gives James even more reason to resent AL.

## 20th Century
- **1910-12-13:** Unable to find a solution after three decades, AL realizes he might need some outside help, so he and James found the [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences]] ^the-founders
	- "Isn't *Longevity* super unethical? Why would other wizards want to help?" There's an easy solution: it's the early 20th Century. No one cares about the fucked up experiments they're doing as long as it's only on minorities and poor people.
- **1951-03-05:** [[Manas Georg|George Ward]] is born
- **1953-11-17:** Inspired by recent atomic tests, IMAS begins to direct research into SOUL fusion under the codename "*Project Dorian*"
- **1961-04-26:** [[Elizabeth Campbell]] is born
- **1964-03-31:** IMAS' board of directors votes to (nominally) expel James and AL
	- "Times have changed, and we can't keep getting away with unethical experiments on the genetically inferior. We're 'cutting ties' with you before the government comes and kicks our asses. No hard feeling, okay?"
	- There were, in fact, hard feelings, even though *Project Dorian* continued in secret.
- **1966-05-01:** The [[CRYSTAL OF GRELLNATH]] is recovered and sent to [[IMAS International Headquarters|IMAS HQ]]
- **1966-09-13**: [[Loretta Campbell]] is born
- **1969-03-28:** [[Louise Campbell]] is born
- **1970-11-21:** James decides to convert the abandoned silver mine into a museum.
- **1973-03-05:** [[Bering Strait Grigori|Grigori Karstov]] is born
- **1975-12-03:** FBI (Furry Bureau of Investigation) raids IMAS HQ, and *Project Dorian* is halted indefinitely. James and AL's continued secret links to the organization are not uncovered, but their influence is now severely limited to almost non-existent.
- **1978-10-20:** AL has a vision in a dream foretelling James's death some time in the 21st Century.
- **1983-12-15:** The [[BLADE OF POWER]] is recovered and sent to an IMAS office in $City for research
- **1984-02-27:** [[Boring Straight Greg|Greg Smith]] is born
- **1990-09-16:** The [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM]] is recovered and sent to an IMAS office in $DifferentCity for research
- **1995-01-13:** James hires Grigori to work at the museum.
- **1996-07-30:** Elizabeth, Loretta, and Louise get gay triple-married
- **1997-04-22:** With the turn of the century (and therefore James's death) fast approaching, a desperate AL conducts a summoning ritual to contact The Emperoress. James pleads with him not to, content to have already lived nearly 200 years, but AL cannot be deterred—he doesn't want to live in a world without James.
	- The ritual involves the CRYSTAL somehow. It has been in AL's possession since it was recovered. The FBI was unaware of its existence.
	- Turns out AL is the one being summoned. He is whisked away to [[Eeby Deeby]], and James is left by himself.

## 21st Century
- **2002-07-15:** [[Case Weston]] is born
- **2003-10-22:** [[Luke Campbell]] is born
- **2003-12-05:** [[Sam Ward]] is born
- **2004-03-09:** [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]] is recovered and sent to the IMAS facility in [[Rhapsody]]
- **2009-08-09:** AL is declared dead in absentia.
- **2012-01-13:** [[Luke's Noble Steed|Pauline]] is born
- **2013-04-13:** James and Grigori get gay married
- **2020-05-29:** Case graduates from [[Plata High School]]
- **2020-08-19:** Sam and Luke begin their junior year at [[Genton High School]]
- **2020-08-24:** Case begins his apprenticeship at IMAS. He is sent to investigate James, who is suspected of defrauding IMAS. (Even though he's officially unaffiliated with them, he still draws a pension or something. Or maybe they want the CRYSTAL back.) ^pension
- **2020-09-18:**
	- **06:30** AL emerges from Eeby Deeby in Sam's house. He turns their father into a gnome (he meant to kill him, but Mr. Ward's unusually high tolerance of [[Mana]] causes the spell to not work as intended), then kidnaps Sam and takes them to [[CURSED AL'S CURSED DOMAIN|his lair]], stealing Mr. Ward's car. (Luke thinks it's just Mr. Ward going to work.)
	- **07:30** When Sam doesn't show up for their morning run, Luke begins to get worried. He looks through their window, rolls a natural 1 on his perception check, and doesn't notice anything out of the ordinary. He remembers the [[Plata Fairgrounds|Renaissance Faire]] is this weekend in Plata and that it's Sam's first year going, so he assumes they were so excited they skipped school. He decides to do the same and saddles up Pauline to go after them.
	- **09:00** AL arrives in Plata, hoping to tell James that he has made a breakthrough. Knowing that James is likely to be at the museum, he goes there. Case, who is working undercover at the museum's front desk and too young to know that AL is supposed to be dead, tells him James isn't there, but he can get his husband, Grigori, if AL would like to talk to him. Through gritted teeth, AL tells him this is acceptable.
	- **09:15** Grigori is a peaceful bear, but it takes all of his willpower not to punch AL in the face. Case is, like, right there, though, so he keeps it together and tells AL in no uncertain terms that James is not interested. Case assumes AL must be some sort of salesperson and doesn't question it further, though he does note the way AL winced when Case referred to Grigori as James's husband. ("A homophobe? In this day and age? What, was he born in the 17th Century or something?") AL fucks off to either look for James or begin searching for the other Artifacts he needs.
		- Grigori is not going to tell James about this. ^not-writing-it
	- **13:00** Luke arrives at the fairgrounds and begins to look for Sam. (He presumably stopped a couple times to let Pauline rest.)

	- **17:00** One of [[The Mothers Campbell|Luke's mothers]] calls him because he hasn't come home yet. Does he tell her the truth? (This could be a player choice.)
		- Yes: They trust he can take care of himself. He'll set up a tent at the fairgrounds, and [[Elizabeth Campbell|Elizabeth]] will be there the next morning. (Luke won't be, though.)
		- No: She doesn't believe him, and he caves and tells the truth anyway. (Luke is too dumb to come up with a convincing lie.) See above. #Gameplay ^susie
	- **18:00** Luke overhears a rumor about the return of an evil wizard named CURSED AL. He has a bit of an overactive imagination, so he begins to entertain the idea that AL is involved in Sam's disappearance somehow but dismisses it as fantasy. (He's not *that* dumb.) 
	- **19:00** Luke hasn't found any sign of Sam, and he's really starting to worry. (Does Sam not have a phone? Maybe it's just going straight to voicemail.) But, he has bigger problems because [[Ednathrallor Verdensmorder|a fucking dragon]] just showed up. All the horses are scared shitless, and Pauline tragically breaks a leg/falls of a cliff trying to run away. Also, Luke's tent and bedroll were still attached to Pauline. (He should have set them up earlier, but he was a bit preoccupied.)
		- Seeing an actual dragon makes him reconsider whether an ancient wizard is involved.

	- **19:30** The fairgoers chase Edna off, and one injures her wing. Edna lets out a mighty roar and leaves. She just came there to have a good time, and honestly, she is feeling so attacked right now. No one was directly injured by the dragon, but there were quite a few people hurt in the ensuing stampede (both the horses and the fairgoers). The story has barely begun, and Luke is already in *way* over his head.
		- Maybe [[Boring Straight Greg]] dies in the stampede. No great loss...
	- **21:00** Obviously, the Faire is cancelled for the rest of the weekend. (No refunds.) But Luke is now stranded in Plata without even a tent. Mom won't be here until the morning, the horse he's known since it was a foal is dead, and he *still* has no idea where Sam is. He sits down against a tree and tries to take some solace in the fact that at least they aren't here to see him cry, but that just makes it worse.

	- **21:15** Case spots Luke and goes to check if he's alright. Luke immediately begins trauma dumping on him, and Case tries to calm him down by telling him about the weird old guy at work today. He introduced himself as "Alain", so Case jokingly suggests that that was [[CURSED AL]]. Unfortunately for Case, Luke believes him and insists that he be taken to James right away to question him about AL. Luke will not take no for an answer, and honestly, he's kinda pathetic (perks of being a dogboy: sad puppy eyes), so Case relents. Bothering James at night might put Case on his bad side and potentially jeopardize his investigation, but he decides that's kind of on IMAS for assigning a 19-year-old apprentice to the case. It's not like he's made much progress anyway.
	- **21:30** Case and Luke arrive at James's house, who, understandably, wants nothing to do with the two teenagers knocking on his door at night. That is, until Luke mentions the name "CURSED AL". James gruffly pulls them both inside. He quickly ascertains that AL has actually returned and that he will have to have a very candid discussion with Grigori later. But, he also realizes there's an opportunity here. The younger one reeks of desperation (and manure). Maybe he can convince Luke to fetch (Luke: Fetch?!) the [[Legendary Artifacts]] for him, and the he can use those to exact his revenge on CURSED AL and [[Institute for the Magical Arts & Sciences|IMAS]].

gameplay:: Luke is a bad liar and/or your choices don't matter. ([[2. Plot Overview (Again)#^susie|ref]])


# Before the Story
## 18th Century
[[CURSED AL]] (known at that time as Alain Bonhomme) begins working on [[Longevity (Spell)|Longevity]]. The spell requires a lot of [[Mana]], so he invents a way to be able to handle more mana than the [[SOUL]] can typically handle. This requires the [[BLADE OF POWER]], the [[CRYSTAL OF GRELLNATH]], the [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM]], and his own invention, [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]], as well as several SOULS and a fuckton of silver. He successfully casts it on himself in 1772, at the age of 106. (He's already extended his life somewhat as a result of his research, but Longevity will make him truly immortal.)
^prototype

## 19th Century
Some 60 years later (1832), an 33-year-old occultist named [[James Redawić]] hears of AL, who still appears to only be in his mid-50s. Naturally, James is curious and becomes an acolyte of AL. AL's secret is closely guarded, but over the course of 10-15 years (1847), James wins him over to the point that they are now romantically involved. AL finally relents and agrees to grant James knowledge of Longevity. However, they will need more silver, so they move.

By 1852, James and AL have acquired [[The Old Silver Mine|a silver mine]] in [[Plata]]. By 1862, they have finally mined enough silver to cast Longevity.

>[!question] Why does it take so long?
>Possible reasons:
>- They're not just mining it for the spell. They're selling it (along with the other metals mined in the process). From [Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/Silver_mining) "Silver-bearing ore typically contains very little silver, with much higher percentages of copper and lead." Due to the highly unethical nature of the spell, they want to keep it on the downlow, so they're only setting aside a little at a time.
>- The mine isn't that good, so they end up not getting very much silver. Plus, it's the early 19th Century. We've been mining silver a long time, but I don't know how effective the extraction and purification techniques were back then. Plus, it probably takes a while to get a mine up and running. (They have [[Magic]] though?)
>- The spell requires a *fuckton* of silver. I said 10 ingots of pure silver, but that's maybe not that much when you literally own a silver mine.
>- Silver isn't the only limiting reagent in the spell.
>- This isn't even in the game. This is literally just backstory. Does it really matter?

AL prepares to cast Longevity on James, but it's been 90 years since the last time he did it. He fucks it up, and instead of getting an extra 7000 years to live, James only gets an extra 70. [question:: How is this known?] James feels like shit for a longer than normal period, but is otherwise okay.

A few years pass (1876), James has recovered, AL finds his old notes, and they've acquired enough resources to attempt casting Longevity a *third* time (the first time being when AL cast it on himself). AL fucks it up *again*, except this time it's even worse. James is paralyzed in the process, and the four Artifacts go *bloop* and get scattered across the tri-state area (some of them might even end up in other Planes of Existence).

![[destroy legendary artifact.jpg]]
Legendary Artifacts are notoriously hard to [[Destroy Legendary Artifact|destroy]].

This time at least, James got an additional 90 years, and it stacks. This means he is fated to die in 2022.

>[!question] Why did the spell fail the second time?
>- The artifacts were tainted by being in close proximity to the mine
>- AL's handwriting is really bad and he couldn't read his own notes
