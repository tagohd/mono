# Before the Story
## 18th Century
[[CURSED AL]] (known at that time as Alain Bonhomme) begins working on [[Longevity (Spell)|Longevity]]. The spell requires a lot of [[Mana]], so he invents a way to be able to handle more mana than the [[SOUL]] can typically handle. This requires the [[BLADE OF POWER]], the [[CRYSTAL OF GRELLNATH]], the [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM]], and his own invention, [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]], as well as several SOULS and a fuckton of silver. He successfully casts it on himself in 1722, at the age of 56.

Some 60 years later (1782), an 33-year-old occultist named [[James RedawiÄ‡]] hears of AL, who still appears to only be in his mid-50s. Naturally, James is curious and becomes an acolyte of AL. AL's secret is closely guarded, but over the course of 10-15 years (1797), James wins him over to the point that they are now romantically involved. AL finally relents and agrees to grant James knowledge of Longevity. However, they will need more silver, so they move.

## 19th Century
By 1802, James and AL have acquired [[The Old Silver Mine|a silver mine]] in [[Plata]]. By 1812, they have finally mined enough silver to cast Longevity.

>[!question] Why does it take so long?
>Possible reasons:
>- They're not just mining it for the spell. They're selling it (along with the other metals mined in the process). From [Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/Silver_mining) "Silver-bearing ore typically contains very little silver, with much higher percentages of copper and lead." Due to the highly unethical nature of the spell, they want to keep it on the downlow, so they're only setting aside a little at a time.
>- The mine isn't that good, so they end up not getting very much silver. Plus, it's the early 19th Century. We've been mining silver a long time, but I don't know how effective the extraction and purification techniques were back then. Plus, it probably takes a while to get a mine up and running. (They have [[Magic]] though?)
>- The spell requires an absolute fuckton of silver. I said 10 ingots of pure silver, but that's maybe not that much when you literally own a silver mine.
>- Silver isn't the only limiting reagent in the spell.
>- This isn't even in the game. This is literally just backstory. Does it really matter?

AL prepares to cast Longevity on James, but it's been 90 years since the last time he did it. He fucks it up, James is paralyzed in the process, and the four Artifacts go *bloop* and get scattered across the tri-state area (some of them might even end up in other Planes of Existence).
