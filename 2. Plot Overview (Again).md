Sometimes it's just easier for me to write a whole new document instead of editing the original in place.

# Before the Story
## 18th Century
[[CURSED AL]] (known at that time as Alain Bonhomme) begins working on [[Longevity (Spell)|Longevity]]. The spell requires a lot of [[Mana]], so he invents a way to be able to handle more mana than the [[SOUL]] can typically handle. This requires the [[BLADE OF POWER]], the [[CRYSTAL OF GRELLNATH]], the [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM]], and his own invention, [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]], as well as several SOULS and a fuckton of silver. He successfully casts it on himself in 1722, at the age of 56.

Some 60 years later (1782), an 33-year-old occultist named [[James RedawiÄ‡]] hears of AL, who still appears to only be in his mid-50s. Naturally, James is curious and becomes an acolyte of AL. AL's secret is closely guarded, but over the course of 10-15 years (1797), James wins him over to the point that they are now romantically involved. AL finally relents and agrees to grant James knowledge of Longevity. However, they will need more silver, so they move.

## 19th Century
By 1802, James and AL have acquired [[The Old Silver Mine|a silver mine]] in [[Plata]]. By 1812, they have finally mined enough silver to cast Longevity.

>[!question] Why does it take so long?
>They're not just mining it for the spell. They're selling it (along with the other metals mined in the process).
