[[2. Timeline]]

# Before the Story
## 18th Century
[[CURSED AL]] (known at that time as Alain Bonhomme) begins working on [[Longevity (Spell)|Longevity]]. The spell requires a lot of [[Mana]], so he invents a way to be able to handle more mana than the [[SOUL]] can typically handle. This requires the [[BLADE OF POWER]], the [[CRYSTAL OF GRELLNATH]], the [[STAFF OF RULKOHIM]], and his own invention, [[CURSED AL'S CURSED ORB]], as well as several SOULS and a fuckton of silver. He successfully casts it on himself in 1772, at the age of 106. (He's already extended his life somewhat as a result of his research, but Longevity will make him truly immortal.)

## 19th Century
Some 60 years later (1832), an 33-year-old occultist named [[James RedawiÄ‡]] hears of AL, who still appears to only be in his mid-50s. Naturally, James is curious and becomes an acolyte of AL. AL's secret is closely guarded, but over the course of 10-15 years (1847), James wins him over to the point that they are now romantically involved. AL finally relents and agrees to grant James knowledge of Longevity. However, they will need more silver, so they move.

By 1852, James and AL have acquired [[The Old Silver Mine|a silver mine]] in [[Plata]]. By 1862, they have finally mined enough silver to cast Longevity.

>[!question] Why does it take so long?
>Possible reasons:
>- They're not just mining it for the spell. They're selling it (along with the other metals mined in the process). From [Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/Silver_mining) "Silver-bearing ore typically contains very little silver, with much higher percentages of copper and lead." Due to the highly unethical nature of the spell, they want to keep it on the downlow, so they're only setting aside a little at a time.
>- The mine isn't that good, so they end up not getting very much silver. Plus, it's the early 19th Century. We've been mining silver a long time, but I don't know how effective the extraction and purification techniques were back then. Plus, it probably takes a while to get a mine up and running. (They have [[Magic]] though?)
>- The spell requires a *fuckton* of silver. I said 10 ingots of pure silver, but that's maybe not that much when you literally own a silver mine.
>- Silver isn't the only limiting reagent in the spell.
>- This isn't even in the game. This is literally just backstory. Does it really matter?

AL prepares to cast Longevity on James, but it's been 90 years since the last time he did it. He fucks it up, and instead of getting an extra 7000 years to live, James only gets an extra 70. [question:: How is this known?] James feels like shit for a longer than normal period, but is otherwise okay.

A few years pass (1876), James has recovered, AL finds his old notes, and they've acquired enough resources to attempt casting Longevity a *third* time (the first time being when AL cast it on himself). AL fucks it up *again*, except this time it's even worse. James is paralyzed in the process, and the four Artifacts go *bloop* and get scattered across the tri-state area (some of them might even end up in other Planes of Existence).

Legendary Artifacts are notoriously hard to [[Destroy Legendary Artifact|destroy]].

This time at least, James got an additional 90 years, and it stacks. This means he is fated to die in 2022.

>[!question] Why did the spell fail the second time?
>- The artifacts were tainted by being in close proximity to the mine
>- AL's handwriting is really bad and he couldn't read his own notes
